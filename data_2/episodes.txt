Morty, you got to... come on. You got to come with me. Rick, what's going on? I got a surprise for you, Morty. It's the middle of the night. What are you talking about? I got a surprise for you. Ow! Ow! You're tugging me too hard. I got a surprise for you, Morty. What do you think of this flying vehicle, Morty? I built it out of stuff I found in the garage. Yeah, Rick, it's great. Is this the surprise? Morty, I had to... I had to... I had to... I had to make a bomb, Morty. I had to create a bomb. What?! A bomb?! We're gonna drop it down there just get a whole fresh start, Morty. Create a whole fresh start. T-t-that's absolutely crazy! Come on, Morty. Just take it easy, Morty. It's gonna be good. Right now, we're gonna go pick up your little friend Jessica. Jessica? From my math class? When I drop the bomb... you know, I want you to have somebody, you know I want you to have the thing I'm gonna make it like a new Adam and Eve, and you're gonna be Adam. And Jessica's gonna be Eve, and so that's the surprise, Morty. No, you can't! Jessica doesn't even know I exist. But but forget about that, because you can't blow up humanity. I-I get what you're trying to say, Morty. Listen, I'm not you don't you don't got to worry about me... trying to fool around with with Jessica or mess around with Jessica or anything. I'm I'm not that kind of guy, Morty. What are you talking about, Rick? You you don't have to worry about me getting with Jessica or anything. She she she she... she's all for you, Morty. I don't care about Jessica! You know what, Morty? You're right. Let's forget the girl all together. She she's probably nothing but trouble, anyways. Arming neutrino bomb. That's it that's it, Rick. I'm taking the wheel. Get off of me, Morty! I'm taking charge of this situation, buddy. What's gotten into you? I'm I'm I'm I'm not gonna stand around like some sort of dumb... What are you, crazy? ...person and just let you blow up the whole world. All right, all right. I'll I'll land. I'll land. I'll land. I'll land the thing. Big tough guy all of a sudden. We'll park it right here, Morty. Right here on the side of the road here. Oh, thank God. You know what? That was all a test, Morty. Just an elaborate test to make you more assertive. It was? Sure. Why not? I don't know. You you know what, mo- Neutrino bomb armed. Um... I see there's a new episode of that singing show tonight. Who do you guys think is gonna be the best singer? Oh, my God. His head is in his food. I'm going to puke. Morty, are you getting sick? I told you not to practice-kiss the living-room pillow. The dog sleeps on it. I wasn't kissing a pillow, mom. I just I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Maybe my dreams were just too loud or something. Or maybe you were out all night again with grandpa Rick. What?! Dad? What, so everyone's supposed to sleep every single night now? You realize that nighttime makes up half of all time? Damn it! Jerry! Beth! Oh, my God. My parents are so loud. I want to die. Mm, there is no God, summer. You got to rip that band-aid off now. You'll thank me later. Okay, with all due respect, Rick... What am I talking about? What respect is due? How is my son supposed to pass his classes if you keep dragging him off for high-concept Sci-Fi rigamarole? Listen, Jerry, I don't want to overstep my bounds or anything. It's your house. It's your world. You're a real Julius Caesar. But I'll tell you some tell you how how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time a bunch of people running around, bumping into each other. G-guy up front says, "two plus two." The people in the back say, "four." Then the bell rings, and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or something. I mean, it's it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. And I know that's not a popular opinion, but it's my two cents on the issue. This was a good breakfast, Beth. You really made the crap out of those eggs. I wish your mother was here to eat them. Oh, dad. What? For real? All right, now, everybody get settled. Get away from the windows! Now, look, we're gonna be dealing with some real serious stuff today. You might have heard of it. It's called math. And without it, none of us would even exist, so let's jump right in. Two plus two. Jessica. Five plus five. Tenssica. Okay, good. It's time for the quiz. Yeah, you know what?! Aw, too bad! Tough! First row, take one. Pass it back for me. The stakes are high in this room. There's crucial things happening here every day. People getting smarter. Some of y'all getting dumber. Some of y'all ain't gonna see 3:00. Hi, Morty. Whoa! Hi, Jessica. Can I show these to you? Wow. Th-they're both great. Thank you. You know what I named these? My little morties. Uh, that's flattering... and a little weird. Do you know what I want you to do with them? Rename them? Squeeze them. Manhandle them. Give them the business. See if you can shuffle them. I mean, really get in there and knock them around. No wrong answers. Wow. Well, okay, Jessica. L-let's give this a shot. Mm. Oh, Morty. What are you doing to me? Uh, I-I'm just doing my best. Morty! What are you doing to me?! Jessica. Morty! Jessica. Five more minutes of this, and I'm gonna get mad. Je-Jessica. Jessica. Not my fault this is happening. Well, well, well. Uh, morning, Frank. "Morning"? What was what is that supposed to mean? You making fun of me? Are you trying to say my family's poor? Oh, geez, Frank. I don't know if a knife is necessary. I mean, you know, y-you kind of had things handled without it. You telling me how to bully now? Big mistake, Morty. And now I'm gonna cut you, 'cause my family's rich. There you are, Morty. Listen to me. I got an errand to run in a whole different dimension. I need an extra pair of hands. Oh, geez, Rick. What'd you do to Frank? It's pretty obvious, Morty. I froze him. Now listen I need your help, Morty. I mean, we got we got to get get the hell out of here and go take care of business. It's important. Come on, Morty. I don't know, Rick. I can't leave school again. Do you have any concept of how much higher the stakes get out there, Morty? What do you think I can just do it all by myself? Come on! Aw, geez. Okay. I guess I can skip history. What about Frank? I mean, shouldn't you unfreeze him? I'll do it later, Morty. He'll be fine. Let's go. Oh, my God. I'm about to walk past Frank Palicky. This is the story we'll be telling our children. Hi, Frank. Aah! Scalpel. Scalpel. Knock, knock. Jerry? My manager gave me an hour for lunch, and I thought, "hey, why not swing by where your wife works?" We're losing him. Okay, he's back. Jerry, please tell me you're here for an incredibly urgent reason. Well, it's lunch. I mean, it's one of three meals that have existed for millennia. Losing him. Stabilized. Okay, I only ask, Jerry, because, as you know, my job involves performing heart surgery. Well, yeah, on horses. Excuse me? Okay. Let's not rehash that fight. I sense that you're busy and will now be on my way. Whoa! What is this on the floor? Some kind of literature for a really nice-looking nursing home. Hey, honey, crazy idea bad pitch let's put your dad here. Let's put your dad in a nursing home. We're losing him. Hey, Tom. We know when we're losing him. We can hear the beeps! There she is. All right. Come on, Morty. Let's go. Oh, geez. Okay. Oh, man, Rick. What is this place? It's dimension 35c, and it's got the perfect climate conditions for a special type of tree, Morty, called a mega tree, and there's fruit in those trees, and there's seeds in those fruits. I'm talking about mega seeds. They're they're incredibly powerful, and I need them to help me with my research, Morty. Oh, man, Rick. I'm looking around this place, and I'm starting to work up some anxiety about this whole thing. All right. All right. Calm down. Listen to me, Morty. I know that new situations can be intimidating. You're looking around, and it's all scary and different, but, you know, m-meeting them head on, charging right into them like a bull that's how we grow as people. I'm no stranger to scary situations. I deal with them all the time. Now, if you just stick with me, Morty, we're gonna be holy crap, Morty, run! I never seen that thing before in my life. I don't even know what the hell it is! We got to get out of here, Morty! It's gonna kill us! We're gonna die! We're gonna die, Morty! Oh, Morty, take a deep breath. Breathe that breathe that fresh air in, Morty. Y-you smell that? That's the smell of adventure, Morty. That's that's the smell of of of of a whole different evolutionary timeline. All right, Rick, look how much longer is this gonna be? Shouldn't I be back at school by now? Are you joking me? I mean, look at all the crazy crap surrounding us. Look at that thing right there. What the hell is that thing? You think you're gonna see that kind of thing at school? Look at it just lumbering around. It defies all logic that thing. Yeah, Rick, I get it. We're surrounded by monsters. That's kind of the reason why I want to leave. Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. Morty, you see this? You see what we just stumbled upon, Morty? Any idea what that is down there? The mega trees? That's right, Morty the mega trees with the mega fruit on them. And that's what I'm talking about, Morty. That's where my seeds are. If we would have done what you wanted, I would have never have found them, because you're so in love with school. All right, all right. So, what's so special about these seeds, anyways? You ask a lot of questions, Morty. Not very charismatic. It makes you kind of an Under underfoot figure. Just take these shoes, Morty. They're special grappling shoes. When you're wearing these things, these babies, you can basically just walk on any surface you want, Morty up, down, below, turn around to the left. These things really bring it all together. Aah! You have to turn them on, Morty! The shoes have to be turned on! I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to grab him and stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's secret? I told you I was ordering you something for Valentine's day. More importantly, your father is a horrible influence on our son. Everything cool in here, Beth? It's fine, Davin. Okay, cool. You know, we did something great today. There's nothing more noble and free than the heart of a horse. Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. Look, I appreciate the stress you're under, but... Morty was having trouble in school way before my dad moved in, and the only influence I can see Rick having... is that, for the first time in his life, Morty has a friend. Well, maybe you're right. Uh, yeah, maybe I am. I'm my father's daughter. I'm smart. Why do you think I'm a heart surgeon? Horse heart surgeon. Hello? Mrs. Smith? This is principal v*g1n*, no relation. I wonder if you and Morty's father might be able to have a chat with me this afternoon? Morty, oh, you really d-did a number on your legs right now. You know, you got to turn the shoes on, Morty, for them to work. Yeah, look I turned mine on. I had no problem getting down here. It was a leisurely breeze. I'm in a lot of pain, Rick. Yeah, I can see that. But do you think you'll still be able to help me collect my seeds, Morty? Are you kidding me?! That's it, Rick! That's the last straw! I can't believe this! I'm sitting here with both of my legs broken, and you're still asking me about getting those seeds?! Ooh! Ow! Oh! Y-y-you're a monster. Y-you're like Hitler, but but even Hitler cared about Germany or something. Okay, hold on just a second, Morty. Ooh. Ohh. Ooh. Wow, Rick. That stuff just healed my broken legs instantly. I mean, I've never felt so good in my life. Thank you. Don't worry about it, Morty. Just come help me get these seeds, all right, buddy? Sure thing, Rick. Not that you asked, Morty, but what just happened there is... I went into a future dimension with such advanced medicine... that they had broken-leg serum at every corner drugstore. The stuff was all over the place, Morty. Wow, that's pretty crazy, Rick. There's just one problem, Morty one little hang-up. The dimension I visited was so advanced, they had also halted the aging process, and everyone there was young, Morty, and they had been forever. I was the only old person there, Morty. It was like I was some sort of, you know, celebrity, walking around. I-I was fascinating to them. There were a lot of attractive women there, Morty, and they they they they all wanted time with me. I had a lot of fun with a lot of young ladies, but I spent so much time there, my interdimensional portal device it's got no charge left, Morty. It's got no charge left. What?! It's as good as garbage, Morty. It's not gonna work anymore, Morty. Oh, geez, Rick, that's not good. W-what are we gonna do? I-I have to be back at school right now. How are we gonna get back home? There's ways to get back home, Morty. It's just it's just gonna be a little bit of a hassle. We're gonna have to go through interdimensional customs, so you're gonna have to do me a real solid. Uh-oh. When we get to customs, I'm gonna need you to take these seeds into the bathroom, and I'm gonna need you to put them way up inside your butthole, Morty. In my butt? Put them way up inside there, as far as they can fit. Oh, geez, Rick. I really don't want to have to do that. Well, somebody's got to do it, Morty. Th-these seeds aren't gonna get through customs unless they're in someone's rectum, Morty. And they'll fall right out of mine. I've done this too many times, Morty. I mean, you're young. You've got your whole life ahead of you, and your a**l cavity is still taut, yet malleable. You got to do it for grandpa, Morty. Y-you've got to put these seeds inside your butt. In my butt? Come on, Morty. Please, Morty. You have to do it, Morty. Oh, man. The fact is, your son, Morty, has attended this school for a total of seven hours over the last two months. What? Why didn't you notify us? I done been notifying you. Have you not been getting the messages I've been leaving with Morty's grandfather? Boom! Told you! In your face! He is ruining our child! Wait, what am I celebrating? Yeah, see, I thought something was fishy there, because it's usually Morty's grandpa that's taking him out of school. Summer? What kind of God lets this happen? We had a little incident. A student was frozen to death. And there's no evidence that a Latino student did it! Everyone wants to take this to a racial place. I won't let them. The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. So, I told him, "give me the blimfarx," you know? This this guy he doesn't understand interstellar currency. It's, like, I'm trying to eat a flimflam like, that's what we eat on girvonesk. The glarp zone is for flarping and unglarping only. I don't like it here, Morty. I can't abide bureaucracy. I don't like being told where to go and what to do. I consider it a violation. Did you get those seeds all the way up your butt? Yeah, Rick. Let's just get this over with, okay? I mean, these things are pointy. They hurt. That means they're good ones. You're a good kid, Morty. Those mega seeds are super valuable to my work. You've been a huge help to me. I'm gonna be able to do all kind of things with them. It's gonna be great, Morty. All kinds of science. Okay, next through. Except you. You go over there. Why does he have to go over there? Random check. He's got to go through the new machine. What new machine? It's a new machine. It detects stuff all the way up your butt. Run, Morty! Run! Aah! Red alert! Ohhhhh! Hey! Ohhhhhh. Aah! Don't think about it! Ooh! Oh, nice, Morty! The student becomes the teacher. Whoooooo! Aah! Aw, hell, no, dawg. You know me I'm just trying to- Aah! I need to type in the coordinates to our home world, Morty. Cover me. Oh, man. I mean, you know, I-I don't want to shoot nobody. They're just robots, Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're robots! Aah! My leg is shot off! Glenn's bleeding to death! Someone call his wife and children! They're not robots, Rick! It's a figure of speech, Morty. They're bureaucrats. I don't respect them. Just keep shooting, Morty. You have no idea what prison is like here! Holy crap! This is insane! Come on, Morty! We got to get the hell out of here! Wow. Did you just come into the cafeteria through a portal? Uh, yeah. Well, you know, my my Ferrari's in the shop. Just kidding. You're Morty, right? Yeah. You can get his number later. Come on, Morty. We got to get out of here. You got to get those seeds out of your ass. Oh, look, honey. It's our son with Albert Ein-douche. What? I'm an angry father, not an improvisor. Oh, hi, Jerry. Oh, my goodness, Morty! What are you doing out of class? We talked about this. Your your parents and I are very disappointed in in this behavior. No? No takers? You guys should really not be touching that stuff. It's beyond your reasoning. You're beyond our reasoning! Takes one to know one. Dad, how could you make my son miss an entire semester of school? I mean, it's not like he's a hot girl. He can't just bail on his life and set up shop in someone else's. What what are you guys doing with my stuff? We're moving you... to a nursing home. A nursing home? What are what are you, nuts? I'm a genius. I build robots for fun. Well, now you can build baskets and watch Paul Newman movies on VHS... and mentally scar the boy scouts every Christmas. What does that mean? It's personal. Dad, mom, come on. Rick just needed my help is all. Morty, stay out of this. You are obviously not capable of judging these situations on your own. What are you trying to say about Morty? That he's stupid or something? Oh, don't high-road us, dad. You know fully well that Morty is the last child that needs to be missing classes. I-I-I don't know what you mean by that. Can can can you be a little bit more specific? Oh, for crying out he's got some kind of disability or something. Is that what you want us to say? I do? Well, duh doy, son. Look, I love you, Morty, but... we both know you're not as fast as the other kids, and if you want to compete in this world, you got to work twice as hard. Aw, geez, dad. Y-you know, that's a lot to drop on a kid all at once. Morty, t-tell your parents the square root of pi. Oh, come on, Rick. You know I can't. The square root of pi, Morty. Go! 1.77245385. Whoa! What the hell? Holy crap. He's right. Morty, tell your parents the first law of Thermodynamics. "The increment in the internal energy of a system is... equal to the increment of heat supplied to the system." Wow! I'm so smart! But I told the both of you school is stupid. It's not how you learn things. Morty's a gifted child. He has a special mind. That's why he's my little helper. He's like me. He's gonna be doing great science stuff later in his life. He's too smart for school. He needs to keep hanging out and helping me. Jerry, I don't want whatever's happening here to stop. No, I-I understand. Uh, maybe we overreacted. But he has to keep going to school. Okay, Jerry. You drive a hard bargain, but what am I supposed to do? Say no? You you really wear the pants around here. I just want you to know, between us, from now on, it's gonna be 100% honesty and open, clear communication. Frank Palicky was frozen to death today! No idea what you're talking about. Okay. Well, uh, Morty, it's your bedtime in an hour. Don't stay up all night again. This is good, though. This can work. I think we can be a family. And now, Beth, if you'll have me, I would love to have you. You know what? Okay. Holy cow, Rick. I didn't know hanging out with you was making me smarter. Full disclosure, Morty it's not. Temporary superintelligence is just a side effect of the mega seeds dissolving in your rectal cavity. Aw, man. Yeah, and once those seeds wear off, you're gonna lose most of your motor skills, and you're also gonna lose a significant amount of brain functionality for 72 hours, Morty. Starting right about now. Ohh, man. Oh, geez! Ohh. I'm sorry, Morty. It's a bummer. In reality, you're as dumb as they come. And I needed those seeds real bad, and I had to give them up just to get your parents off my back, so now we're gonna have to go get more. And then we're gonna go on even more adventures after that, Morty. And you're gonna keep your mouth shut about it, Morty, because the world is full of idiots that don't understand what's important, and they'll tear us apart, Morty. But if you stick with me, I'm gonna accomplish great things, Morty, and you're gonna be part of them, and together, we're gonna run around, Morty. We're gonna do all kinds of wonderful things, Morty. Just you and me, Morty. The outside world is our enemy, Morty. We're the only friends we've got, Morty. It's just Rick and Morty. Rick and Morty and their adventures, Morty. Rick and Morty forever and forever. 100 years, Rick and Morty's things. Me and Rick and Morty running around, and Rick and Morty time. All day long, forever. All a hundred days. Rick and Morty forever 100 times.So, dad, guess what tomorrow is. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. No. Well, it... might be. It is. Fine. But also, tomorrow is your one-year anniversary back in our lives. I'm gonna make you flying-saucer-shaped pancakes. Oh, t-t-there's no need to do that, Beth. Regular pancakes are fine. Oh, my God! Oh, what is happening?! Happy anniversary, dad. Oh, I get it. Regular pancakes are already shaped like flying saucers. I-I should be making you breakfast for putting up with me. You should be making us a whole restaurant. Nonsense. We couldn't be happier to have you around. I just wish I got to see more of you. Rick Sanchez of earth dimension C-137, you are under arrest for crimes against alternate Ricks by the authority of the trans-dimensional council of Ricks. Hey! What the heck?! Neutralize the Jerry. Wait! No! I'll -- Dad! Dad! Rick! Everybody, relax. If I know these a-holes, and I am these a-holes, they just want to haul me to their stupid clubhouse and waste my time with a bunch of questions. Let's get it over with. Bring his Morty. Oh, man. Leave my Morty out of this. You lost the right to have a say in these things when you refused to j-- join the council. W-w-w-what about Jerry? Will you at least unfreeze my daughter's idiot? ...Give you anything! I have a rare antique-coin collection! Just don't hurt me! Okay, maybe not antique, but it was a limited minting. They have little R2-D2s instead of George Washington. Our son's been abducted! You hate me for buying those coins! Geez, Rick, w-what is this place? The citadel of Ricks. It's the secret headquarters for the council of Ricks. Council of Ricks? As you know, Morty, I've got a lot of enemies in the universe that consider my genius a threat -- galactic terrorists, a few sub-galactic dictators, most of the entire intergalactic government. Wherever you find people with heads up their asses, someone wants a piece of your grandpa, and a lot of versions of me on different timelines had the same problem, so a few thousand versions of me had the ingenious idea of banding together like a herd of cattle or a school of fish or those people who answer questions on yahoo! Answers. Hey! What do you know? It's a cowboy version of me. Geez, you're easy to impress. Yeah, most timelines have a Rick, and most Ricks have a Morty. This place is a real who's who of who's you and me. Turn your boring, old Morty into a-- hot fashion statement with some Morty dazzlers. Hey, check this out. Show me the Morty. Dumb. Excuse me, sir, is your Morty insured? You know, every year, hundreds of Mortys are injured -- Back off! Not my cup of tea, this place. I say the point of being a Rick is being a Rick. Save your anti-Rick speech for the council of Ricks, terror-Rick. Hey, save your Rick rules for the sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig. [beep] me, pal. [beep] you? No, no, no, no, no. [beep] me. Bring up the holograms. 27 Ricks brutally murdered in their own timelines-- an unprecedented Rick-icidal epidemic. What say you, earth Rick C-137? You think I did this? Why am I the first Rick you pull in every time a Rick stubs his toe? You have a history of non-cooperation with the council. Yeah, so does the scientist formerly known as Rick. W-w-w-w-w-why isn't he here in handcuffs? Because he's dead, too! Who else would you have us question? You fit the profile. Of all the Ricks in the central finite curve, you're the malcontent, the rogue. I'm the Rick, and so were the rest of you before you formed this stupid alliance. You wanted to be safe from the government, so you became a stupid government. That makes every Rick here less Rick than me. Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got pancakes back home with syrup on top of them. They're about to hit that critical point of syrup absorption that turns the cakes into a gross paste, and I hate to get all Andy Rooney about it, but I think we all like Fluffy disks of cake with syrup on top, and I think we also like to be accused of crimes when there's evidence! So, as they say in Canada, peace oot! Evidence! Good idea. Scan his portal gun! Oh, come on. Don't look at another man's portal-gun history. We -- we all go to weird places. Yes, but it appears you alone have been going to the exact timelines and locations in which the murders occurred. What?! That's Rick-diculous! I'm obviously being set up. Earth Rick C-137, the council of Ricks sentences you to the machine of unspeakable doom, which swaps your conscious and unconscious minds, rendering your fantasies pointless while everything you've known becomes impossible to grasp. Also, every 10 seconds, it stabs your balls. I've heard enough. Run, Morty! Unh-unh. Not you. Aaaah! No! Oh! Oh! Yeah, I'd like to order one large person with extra people, please. White people. No, no, no, no. Black people. And hispanic on half. Yes, I'd like to order one large sofa chair with extra chair, please. High chair. No, no, no, no. Recliner. And wheelchair on half. They could have gone into any one of these. Son of a... Oh, geez. Oh, man! We lost 'em. Yeah, I'd like to order one large phone with extra phones, please. Cellphone. No, no, no, no. Rotary. And pay phone on half. That'll keep 'em busy for a while. Those guys were wrong, right? Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn't kill yourself -- yourselves. Of course not, Morty. How could that profit me? But someone out there is killing Ricks, and the council ain't gonna stop thinking it's me until we clear our names -- by finding the real Rick-killer. I'm scared, Rick. Maybe we should go home and stockpile weapons, like that show "doomsday preppers". Not really my style, Morty. Besides, your home is most likely swarming with Ricks by now. All right, listen, Jerry. If Rick calls, this device is gonna trace his location. You just got to keep him on the phone for 30 seconds or longer. Who wants lemonade? Oh, yeah. Mmm! Oh! Delicious! Beth you're a treasure. I have a Beth just like you in my reality, except you know what? She's not as brilliant or attractive. Aw. Thank you. Oh! She did! She did it! H-hello? Hey, Jerry, it's Rick. Rick! Hey. What's -- what's up? So, listen, the heat's on, and there's nowhere left to turn, so Morty and I are just gonna fly my spaceship into a black hole. What?! Is that cool with you, dawg? Rick, no! Morty!! We got it. The call's coming from... ♪ inside the house ♪ Look at his face! You dummy! Can't believe our daughter married you. Too easy! The Ricks are probably gonna waste some time messing with Jerry. They won't be able to help themselves. But as soon as they get bored, they'll be onto us. Phones à la clams and phonesghetti with phone balls. Anything else? Yeah, more phone sticks, please. Right away, sir. You know, Rick, when I first saw all those Ricks and Mortys, I thought, "Gee, that kind of devalues our bond". But then I realized it just means that our relationship must be pretty special to span over all those different timelines. Yeah, it's got to be that way. You're a camouflage. Camouflage? What are you talking about, Rick? Ricks have a very distinctive and traceable brain wave due to our genius. The best way to hide from an enemy's radar is to stand near someone with complementary brain waves that make ours invisible. See, when a Rick is with a Morty, the genius waves get canceled out by the, uh... Morty waves. Um... Because o-our personalities are so different? Oh, sh1t, dawg. My portal gun was hacked remotely, Morty-- obviously by the real killer, to frame me. But I was able to trace the signal. Come on. Let's go. Uh-oh. Excuse me. We've tracked a pair of dangerous criminals to this exact location. They look exactly like us, so in order to avoid confusion, I'm gonna mark us each with a red "X" right now. That way, if someone has a gun and we both tell you to shoot the other one because they're the evil one, you'll know who's lying. Hey, check it out. Damn it! Hey, you didn't pay your bill! The red "X"! Red "X"! Hey, it's a good thing that space outlet had lab coats and your favorite kind of shirt in stock, huh, Morty? Yeah, Rick, I-I heard you the first time. You don't have to keep saying it over and over. Man, this place is way off the grid. This guy does not want to be found. Well, if he's a Rick, doesn't he just have to stand by a Morty to hide? I mean, isn't that what Mortys are -- human cloaking devices? Morty, you're making a bigger deal out of this than it is. Oh, my God, Rick, look! There's a bunch of people strapped all over that building! Not people, Morty -- Mortys. Oh, God! W-w-why would somebody do this? It's horrible! Well, one Morty's enough to hide from the bureaucrats, but you get -- you get a whole matrix of Mortys and put them in agonizing pain, that creates a pattern that can hide even from other Ricks [beep]. I fiddled with a concept like this once. On paper, Morty. On paper. I wouldn't do this. It's barbaric overkill. I mean, you could accomplish the same result with, like, five Mortys and a jumper cable. Which I also wouldn't do! I'm just saying, it's bad craftsmanship. Coffee time! Yeah! Yo, yo, yo, yo! That's what I like to hear! Hi, Jerry. Leave me alone. I'm working. Oh, you are? W-w-w-what do you do? I-I'm -- I'm in between advertising jobs. Advertising? Wow! So, people need help figuring out what to buy, and then y-y-you help 'em? Well, it's a little more complicated than that. Well, I mean, you do it, and you seem like a guy who really has it all together. Dude, are you -- w-- you're being a dick, right? Oh, gosh, I-I hope not. I wouldn't want to offend you in any way. You're really a Rick? Y-- of course I am -- just as much as my Morty's a Morty. Hey, he looks a lot like Eric Stoltz from the movie "mask." You know, the one with Cher in it? That's right, Jerry! He -- he's from a reality where everyone is Eric Stoltz "mask" people. He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty. They assigned him to me because I never had any kids of my own. But if I did, boy, I'd love them if they were as smart and as successful as you are, Jerry. Hey, get a load of this. Jerry's hanging out with doofus Rick. This is perfect. I'm not doofus Rick! I'm Rick j19-zeta-7! Oh, is that the timeline where everybody eats poop? Jerry, you know this guy eats poop, right? Hey, I don't eat poop! Y-you guys are always so mean to me. I guess it's only fair to tell you now, Jerry. I'm the worst Rick of them all. According to who -- other versions of you? If I've learned one thing, it's that before you get anywhere in life, you got to stop listening to yourself. Wow. You really are wise, Jerry. I-I-I guess that's why you work in advertising. The fact that you feel that way makes you the best Rick of them all. You don't care about me at all! I'm no different than that jacket you've got on! Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal gun! I'm just a tool! I-I-I'm just an object! Hey, it's your choice to take it personally, Morty. Now, for the love of God, be quiet. The point of this is to get the drop on the guy. You know what, Rick? I'll tell you something! I'm more than a human shield! Yeah, that's right. You are. You're a perfect, impenetrable suit of human armor, Morty, because you're as dumb as I am smart, which is why when I say "shut up," it's really good advice. Great. Nice work, Morty. Ooh. Look at you, C-137. You -- aren't you a tough customer. The slow clap? Really? Kind of played out, dude. Not in this dimension, it isn't. In fact I invented it. Nobody else has ever even done it here before. Well, la-di-da. Hey, that's mine! I don't like the look of that Rick, Morty. We got to escape. I'm not gonna help you, Rick. Y-you're a monster. Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty. Will you -- will you stop saying that? It's stupid. Take his Morty away. Come with me. Yeah, gladly. Geez, man. Ricks, huh? Hey, man, you seem to know how this place works. Is there any way we could shut down that grid and rescue all those Mortys outside? It would be pointless. Mortys have no chance of defeating a Rick. In here. Ah. Isn't it beautiful? Yeah, yeah. Looks like payday at Neverland ranch in here. Zing! That guy got it. Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet. You're missing my symphony. Hey, I'll take it over Mumford & Sons. Zip! This guy is on it! He's not laughing at your dumb jokes, Rick. That's just a random noise it makes every 10 seconds. You see, Rick, you're not as clever as you think you are. I wanted you to find me. We're not so different, you and I. Yeah, duh! See this right here, Rick? I crunched the numbers. I created a spectrum of all the Ricks. I listed them out from most evil to least evil. Here's where I am. And look it -- right here's where you are, Rick. This guy right here -- super-weird. I get it. So you want me to team up with you to take down the council of Ricks, right? Is that where you're going with this? 'Cause that's where I'd be going. Please. I think I'm doing pretty good on my own. I'm simply gonna download the contents of your brain and then kill you. Okay, if we add a little more titanium nitrate and just a tad of chlorified tartrate... Ovenless brownies! Mmm. Mmm! It's incredible what a gifted mind can accomplish when priorities are in order. Well, come on. I can't take all the credit, Jerry. It was your idea. Come here, Jerry! Hey, uh, come here. I-I want to show you something. Okay, look, everybody makes fun of me for getting these, but you're a genius scientist. What do you think? See? There's little R2-D2s where the George Washingtons should be. You know, Jerry, I'm not gonna tell you that these will increase in value or even hold their current value. The truth is, you bought them because you like them. They have value to you. That's what matters. How long are you staying? Until we find your Rick. I found mine. Help! There is no escape, my son. We will find our peace in the next world. So, what -- you're just gonna give up? We're giving in -- to the power of the one true Morty. One day, he will return. Praise the one true Morty. Ugh. All right, Mortys, listen up. My name is Morty Smith, from earth dimension C-137. I know you're scared, because I'm scared. But that's no reason to accept our fate! We're Mortys! We're not defined by our relationships to Rick! Our destiny is our own! This sounds like something the one true Morty might say. I'm sick of being a human shield. I want to be a gardener! I want to write really crazy, intense action novels! I'm more than just a hammer! He is the one true Morty! Hooray! The one true Morty! Hey, keep it down! You've lived quite a life, Rick. It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through. You're crying? Over a Morty? No, I'm just allergic to dipshits. Ugh. Pathetic. We both know that if there's any truth in the universe, it's that Ricks don't care about Mortys. Do your worst, you little bastards! Kill me! Do it! Do I-I-I-I-it! Morty! Thank God! Get me out of this. Come on! You're lucky I'm not a Rick. Point taken, but this is no time for arcs. Oh! Yeah, hello. Hey, what do me and O.J. not have in common? Huh? W-who is this? I found the real killer, bitch! Get over here! Yo, ding-dong, we're done here. Time to go. Well, Jerry, I guess this means goodbye. W-w-well, does it have to? I mean, you -- you look just like Rick. We could maybe, you know, get rid of him. I'm not saying kill him, necessarily. I -- I'm also not saying necessarily not kill him, but -- Jerry, w-we both know it wouldn't work. It's time to go back to our lives. I love you, Jerry. I love you. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! W-what -- w-what's gonna happen to all these Mortys? They'll go back to their families, attend school regularly, play video games, date girls. Poor little rickless bastards. Earth Rick C-137, the council apologizes for its false accusation, and in the way of reparations for our terrible mistake, we would like to compensate you with this voucher for a free replacement Morty in the event that your current Morty should -- Uh, guys, not a good time. Come on, Morty. Let's hit it. Is it time for arcs yet, Rick? I did a pretty good job back there for a human cloaking device. Saved your ass. All right, Morty. Don't break an arm jerking yourself off. Man, I can't believe you, Rick. That right there, that w-- that was a great opportunity to show a little humanity, you know? To connect with me a little. Hey, Morty, you want connection, go be part of some stupid club, like all those dumb Ricks. You know, maybe I don't connect because I'm the rickest Rick there is. And, you know, it would g-- Go without saying that the rickest Rick would have the Mortyest Morty. It would go without saying, huh? Yeah, it would. Did you hear me say it? Nah. The Mortyest Morty. Just don't get too big for your loafers, Buster brown. A cocky Morty can lead to some big problems. It can be a real bad thing for everybody. Oh, yeah? How's that? U-uh, I'll explain when you're older. What a mess. Pride cometh before the fall. I guess he got what he deserved. What is that? Hand me the laser difibulator. Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help? No! Go clean the toilets. Maybe you'll make friends with some turds. You make us ashamed to be ourselves! My God. I've seen this technology before. This Rick was being controlled remotely -- puppeteered by somebody else. This is the receiver. Yeah, but where's the transmitter? Wubba dubba dub dub! Oh. Hey, Jerry. What are you doing in my room, buddy? Nothing. I was just, um, checking the smoke detectors. All right. Okay, get out. What's that dipshit doing out there? Are you friends with him? You know he eats his own sh1t, right? Oh, my God, this is rich! I've got like 10 Ricks to call right now.Bye, mom! Bye, dad! Drive carefully! Have fun, you two. Yes, we will have as much fun as possible on our... Titanic -themed getaway. Let's lose the 'tude, please. It's supposed to be romantic. Speaking of disasters, dad, we are leaving you in charge, here. I know, c-can we wrap this up? Morty and I have some synthetic laser eels oxidizing in the garage. Hey, don't blow me off. I am drawing a line, okay? Any damage to this house or these children when we get back, and... no more adventures with Morty. Aw, geez, Rick. If my mom's the one who's saying it, then you know it's pretty serious this time. That's right. Wait. What? Listen, you have my word as a caregiver, everything's gonna be fine. And if not, like you say, no more adventures or whatever. It's like that old song "blomp blomp-a noop noop a-noop noop noop". You guys know that song? From tiny rogerts? You never heard of it? You know, the black effeminate guy from the '50s? No-nobody? A-all right, whatever. Look, who cares? Just go on your stupid trip. Not one thing out of place. Not a single thing. Well, we're past the point of no return. I'm going to have a party. I found jello. Can you sneak your mom's vodka? Yes, she does. I saw it in your laundry room. Listen, you can't both be in denial about it. Okay, bye. Summer, you can't throw a party! Remember what mom said? Yeah, if anything gets messed up, you and grandpa Rick get punished. I'm only a human being, Morty. Rick, tell summer she can't have a party! Uh, summer, you can't have a party. Because I'm having a party, b-I-I-I-itch! Oh, what?! Rick, you can't! What do you mean you're having a party? Are some glip glops from the third dimension going to come over and play cards or something? "Glip glop?" You're lucky a traflorkian doesn't hear you say that. Is that like their n-word? It's like the n-word and the c-word had a baby and it was raised by all the bad words for Jews. Listen, I think the three of us could just, you know, have a nice time, like just hanging out, and, you know, doing a little bonding and -- screw that. This is my chance to gain some footing with the cool kids. That's why you party? Boy, you really are 17. Why do you party? To get wr-wriggedy wriggedy wrecked, son! Just keep your Sci-Fi friends away from my awesome ones. Yeah, and you keep your awesome friends away from my canapes. After dinner, Titanic 2 will attach to the rail system near our replica iceberg, and the hydraulics encased in these tubes will execute a controlled sink into the icy depths. A rail system seems archaic for an attraction this impressive. Are you sure the ship will sink? I can assure you the ship will sink, as it has a thousand times before. It is un-unsinkable. Ooh! Look, it's the line for the bow! Jerry, I'd love to just kick back with a Margarita and read. Do you mind if I skip the whole "king of the world" bit? Well, it's not the "king of the world" bit. That's Jack and fabrizio. This is where rose says, "I'm flying, Jack!" But whatever. I can be the only one to do it alone. Well, what about her? Excuse me, ma'am. Would you like to take my place in line? I, uh -- I could get into trouble. We won't tell. So... You're a Titanic fanatic? Oh, yes. I've worked here since it opened, but I've never been able to participate. Happy to help... rose. I love watching bukkake. I mean, like, I don't know if I personally would ever do it... Brad! Hey! Yo. Brad is here! Quick, make my hair look drunk. Check it out. Tammy's already drunk. Cool. The beacon was activated. Who is in danger? Ugh! Grandpa! Birdperson! I am pleased there is no emergency. Oh, there's an emergency, all right. A emergency! When's the last time you got laid, 'pers? It has been a... challenging mating season for birdperson. Then it's time to get your beak wet tonight, playah. Go have some fun out there birdp-- bird-- birdperson. Oh, man, how many people did you invite, Rick? Uh... people? Mm, six. Yo! What up, my glip glops?! Oh, man! Oh! Y-y-you know there's a garbage, right? Hey, uh, what the hell?! Ooh. That's why you never invite a floopy doop and a shmoopy doop to the same party. Oh, oh, g-- oh, that's disgusting! You guys are in my parents' bed! Oh. Sorry. I'm not feeling too well. I just needed to lie down for a bit. Oh. Okay. S-s-sorry. Oh, my God! Are you kidding me?! The thing people don't realize about the Gear Wars is that it was never really about the gears at all. Uh-huh. Yeah. No, no, to-totally. Rick, you got to stop -- Morty! Have you met gearhead? Hey, how's -- Morty here, he -- he would love to hear all about the Gear Wars. How familiar are you with the Gear Wars, exactly? Uh... Not at all. Oh, boy. I envy you. Okay, it was about 754 years ago... Oh, hey, Morty! H-have you -- have you met my buddy scropon? Not again, Rick. That last guy droned on for 20 minutes, you know? And meanwhile, the whole house is being destroyed! Whoa, Morty, this guy's entire planet was destroyed. Have a little perspective. Hey, Rick, squanchy party, bro! Aw! Squanchy! Is there a good place for me to squanch around here? Squanchy, you can squanch wherever you want, man. Mi casa es su casa, dawg! All right! I like your squanch! Uh, Rick, what exactly is "squanching"? Morty, listen -- we've had a lot of really cool adventures over the last year, but it's time to relax. Yeah, if I relax now, there might not even be any more adventures! Jesus, Morty, you're bumming me out. Can't we just pretend like everything's fine for a few hours, enjoy ourselves, and then worry about all this later? Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Rick. You know, you like not caring about stuff. You know, wh-wh-what's in this for me? For me? Jessica. Knock it off, slow mobius! Ha ha! Sorry, dude! I'm just trying to show off my powers, bro! I can't believe she's here. Well, what are you doing standing here, Morty? Go. Talk to her. Tonight, the only adventure you're on is your cusping manhood. Oh, Rose. Whee! Is that what I think it is? Yes, every couple gets to re-create Jack's drowning at the end of the movie. It's so romantic. I can't wait to do that with Beth. I don't know, Jerry. With all due respect, it seems like your wife may not be that interested. Look! Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Iceberg, right ahead! The buffet is now closed. Uh, sir? There's not a problem. What do you mean there's not a problem? The guidance system isn't putting us on a direct collision course. This ship is about to completely miss the giant iceberg! Well, do something! Steer into it! I'm trying! It's too late. Ladies and gentlemen... Don't brace yourselves. No! No! What happened?! Their rail system must have failed. Oh, my God! We're not gonna sink! Totally gonna get laid tonight. I like your feathers. They are designed to attract the attention of the female. It's working. Tammy, I should let you know I just got out of a highly intense soul bond with my previous spirit mate. I'm not looking to get into a soul bond. I'm just looking for... I believe birdperson can arrange that. Hey, Summer, haven't seen you at flute practice in a while. Summer, don't tell me you're friends with her. Are you kidding me? I don't even know what she's doing here. Whoa. Not cool, summer. This is a party. Everybody should be welcome. Oh, great. Who invited Abradolph Lincoler? I thought everyone was welcome. It's not the same, Summer. Lincoler is a crazed maniac -- just a misguided effort of mine to create a morally neutral superleader by combining the DNA of Adolf Hitler and Abraham Lincoln. Turns out it just adds up to a lame, weird loser. Rick, you brought me into this world, a suffering abomination tortured by the duality of its being. But I shall finally know peace when I watch the life drain from your wretched body! Whoa. What's up, man? I have no quarrel with you, boy. "Boy"? What's that supposed to mean? It's just -- l-look, I-I don't know how you thought I meant it, but... Don't look at me, dude. Look, I'm half-Abraham Lincoln, so -- So I should get on my knees and kiss your ass?! Well, no, but... You know? What do I know? That the third reich will reign for a thousand years? Leave him alone, Brad. Stay out of this, Jessica! Kick his ass, Brad! Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Kick his ass! Brad! Rick! I just did you a favor, Morty. Sorry about all that. Rick has some really strange friends. Ugh! Brad is such a jerk. He's always trying to prove what a man he is. I just want to find somebody nice and sweet. Jessica, can I show you something? Wow! Look at all this stuff. Yeah. This is me and my grandpa Rick's Sci-Fi workshop. Check this out. It's beautiful. You know, Jessica, there's something I've always wanted to tell you. What's that, Morty? I think that you're the most -- No, that -- those weird sounds coming from the closet over there. Oh, my God! Aah! Hey, I'm squanching in here! Oh, my God! Oh, that is so disgusting! Ow! Oh! Oh, crap! Huh. Big star in the sky. Oxygen-rich atmosphere. Giant testicle monsters. We'll be fine! Let's party! ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ I swear to God, Morty, if it weren't for the fact that everyone's still having a blast in there, I would be so furious with you right now. Oh, man. Y-you hear that, Morty? You really lucked out with Summer o-on that one. How are you guys not freaking out right now?! T-the whole house is sitting in another dimension! I-I mean, w-what the hell are we supposed to do?! M-m-mom and dad are gonna kill us! I'm losing it here, Rick! Relax, Morty, relax! It's gonna be fine. All we have to do is go out and find us some kalaxian crystals. Oh, sh1t, mother [beep]! Kalaxian crystals, Morty, just a few miles South of here. Okay. Let's go, then. W-w-we got to go get those crystals right now, Rick. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Morty, Morty, I-I can't go with you. I got to hang back and make sure everything stays cool here, you know? I mean, who knows what -- what if somebody breaks something? Yeah. Me too. I should stay. You guys have any aspirin? Oh, hey, Morty, this is perfect! You can take Lincoler with you. Hey, man, I'm not going anywhere. I'm injured. Shut up, Lincoler. It's the least you can do for wrecking the living room. Yeah! And, Nancy, you should go, too. What? Why -- why me? Because, uh, you're -- you're so good at playing the flute. Sorry for the inconvenience, folks. We should resume sinking shortly. In the meantime, please, stay on the ship and enjoy a complimentary plate of James Cameronion rings. Great. Not only is the ship not sinking, but now the fourth wall has been broken. I am gonna go back to the room to finish my book. You should find that Lucy woman. But -- but -- You see, Jerry? May I show you something? Had everything gone as planned, this entire area would be underwater. I would have liked to see it. This trip has been a "Titanic" failure. Get it? Ooh! Draw me, Jerry. Oh, boy. Lucy, wow. Uh, this isn't what I had in mind. But it's the perfect moment. We've been dreaming about this for 16 years. Um, not like this. Not -- not with you. You are gonna draw me. Aah! Then you're going to [beep] me in that car over there. It's weird, 'cause I definitely think that all men are created equal. But, at the same time -- Okay! Um, the crystals should be really close. There they are! Wait. Something's not right. Get the crystals! I'll handle the beast! Prepare to be emancipated from your own inferior genes! Summer's gonna like me again. Lincoler, come on! Let's get out of here! Mein journey is over, Morty. I have something important to tell you. ♪ And the gears, they turned for a thousand years ♪ ♪ until the dark day that they stopped ♪ Rick, I got them! I got the crystals! All right! You did it, Morty. Rick, wait! There's something you need to know. I couldn't have done it without Lincoler. He said that he was really sorry and that he loves you like a father. He only wanted you to accept him, and he hopes that his final act would redeem him in your eyes. He sacrificed himself to save all of us, Rick. He died. Well, at least he didn't die in vain. He got these crystals. And these babies just saved this lame-ass party! Wubba, lubba, dub, dub! Play something. Somebody, play something. Wait a minute.

But, listen, speaking of those crystals, can I get the rest of them? I'm starting to come down, Morty. Crystal kalaxian is a really strong, but fleeting high. That's what I think of your crystals, Rick! Oh, Morty, you idiot! Does anybody else have any more k-lax? B-birdperson? Uh, squanchy? Don't squaunch at me. All right, everybody, party is officially over! Rick, take us home now. All right, all right, fine, Morty, you party pooper buzzkill! Boo, boo! Morty sucks! Boo! You suck, whatever your name is. Boo! Morty, you're the worst, Morty. But these gears just started turnin'. Almost finished, Jerry? Uh, almost. I haven't quite captured your beautiful eyes. I'm sure it's good enough. Move! Every weekend, Jacks and Roses have their Titanic experience in this car, and I have to mop it up. The floor drops out to make it easier. But now it's my turn. We're going to get it nice and steamy in there, and I'm going to slam my hand on the steam and leave a nice handprint, and then you're going to love inside of me. No mess. No clean. Beth! Bet you're glad I think kindles are dumb now. I can't help but feel a little guilty. I didn't peg Lucy for a rapist. What does a rapist look like exactly, Beth? Is it a slavic man wearing a denim jacket with a patchy beard and the scent of cheap champagne wafting over his blister-pocked lips? What? Well, at least you got all this free stuff. Should be enough to satisfy your Titanic Jones for a while. I'm not going to fit. Beth, listen to me. You're going to get out of here. You're gonna go on, and -- Jerry, just leave the door. It's not a door, Beth. It's debris. I don't care. Just leave it. Yeah. Okay. "Cape fear"! "Cape fear"! I'm -- I'm doing -- I'm -- I'm going to do like from "cape fear". Hey, squanchers! The party's squanching on at my place! Cool. I'm coming, too. Uh, no. You're not squanchy enough for a squanchy party. What? Nancy told us what a bitch you are. Guys, seriously. Nancy? Summer, you're a bad person. All you care about is having popular people like you. That's not what Abradolph Lincoler stood for. Well, I-it was hard to pin down what he stood for, but it's certainly not what he died for. Next time I party, I'm just gonna focus on getting totally wrecked. You're so wise. May I assist you with that? Uh, sure, yeah. Thanks. Morty, do you know what "wubba lubba dub dub" means? Uh, that's just Rick's stupid nonsense catchphrase. It's not nonsense at all. In my people's tongue, it means, "I am in great pain. Please help me." Well, I got news for you. He's saying it ironically. No, Morty. Your grandfather is, indeed, in very deep pain. That is why he must numb himself. Come on, um... Birdperson. Come on, birdperson. Rick's not that complicated. He's just a huge asshole. Then why do you care so much if you are no longer allowed to continue on your adventures together? It appears fate has presented you with an opportunity to free yourself of Rick forever. You know what? You're right. I shouldn't even care. This is probably the best thing that could have happened to me. I'm sick of having adventures with Rick. My people have another saying-- "gubba nub nub doo rah kah". It means, "whatever lets you sleep at night". Guys, mom and dad are, like, right around the corner. This is your moment, Morty. Choose wisely. Tammy! Caw! Wow. We are so screwed. Rick, wake up. Huh? What? Wait? What? What? Stop. Rick, you got to do something quick. My parents are home. Uh, all -- all right. All right. Hold -- hold on. Ahh! So good. Oh, my God. They're walking up the driveway. Bring me the thing. What -- what thing? The thing. The thing. The -- the -- it's got, like, buttons on it and lights on it. It -- it -- it beeps. Rick! That describes everything in your garage! Do you mean this? Summer for for the win. All right, that should do it. Whoa! What did you do? Uh, s-see for yourself. Whoa! Yeah, e-everything's frozen in time. Yeah, and slow mobius thinks he's all that. For how long? I don't know. How long do you guys want? A week? A month? Can we start cleaning the house and see how we feel? Worst movie ever. Dumb. Ooh, boy, what a waste of time. Get it? You know, 'cause it's frozen. This has been so much fun. Hey, Rick. You know, this whole time, I haven't once heard you say that "wubba lubba dub dub" thing that you usually say. Don't need to. I have a new catchphrase. Oh, yeah? What -- what's that, Rick? I love my grandkids. Aww. Psych! Just kidding -- my new catchphrase is, "I don't give a [beep]". ♪ Just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ ♪ just shake that ass, bitch, and let me see whatcha got ♪ Roll credits! ♪ Just shake that a-- Roll the credits!

We froze time for a pretty long time, so when I un-freeze it, the world's time is gonna be fine, but our time's gonna need a little time to, you know, stabilize. Our time is gonna be unstable? What does that even mean? It means relax and stop being a pussy, Morty. Uh, I thought you learned that by now. It also means don't touch your parents, or we could shatter into countless theoretical shards. Wait a minute, what? And away we Go! [ Device warbles ] ♪♪ Um... did we ever put that mattress under Mr. Benson? Shhh. Shush, Morty. A thing or two about... Wait, what? Was the house... When we pulled up, I could have sworn the house was completely trashed. Negative visualization, Jerry. Explains a lot about where you're at. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Dad. Summer, Morty, are you okay? We... we just missed you a lot. Yeah, we missed you so much. Too much to hug you, though. Yeah, it would literally destroy them. Now, listen, why don't... Why don't... wh-why don't... Why don't you guys go get a free Sunday ice cream? Get out there and get some ice creams. Here's $500 cash in unmarked monies. I'm just gonna put it on the floor and kick it on over to ya. You guys Go nuts. This better not be a bribe. If I find a single thing out of place in this house, my love of ice cream won't save you. I'll get my jacket. Sweetie, is your shirt on backwards? [ All gasp ] Yeah. I like it this way. I'm not stupid. Phew! Oh. Man, that guy is the redgren grumbholdt of pretending he knows what's going on. [ Rick and Summer laugh ] Oh, you agree, huh? It's funny. You like that redgren grumbholdt reference? Yeah. Well, guess what? I made him up. You really are your father's children. Think for yourselves. Don't be sheep. [ Dramatic electronic music plays ] [ Electricity crackles ] God, I feel terrible. Yep, it really makes you appreciate how fickle the universe can be. One minute you're falling off a roof for six months, the next minute, bam! Uh, just to be clear, it was Summer's job to put the mattress under... Uh, what? It was your job, Morty. Nuh-uh! Yuh-huh! Actually, sorry, Summer. I got to back the "m" bomb on this one. I remember the conversation. We told Morty to replace all the bank's money with cookies. Your job was to put the mattress under Mr. Benson. Boom! In your face, Summer! You really dropped the ball, man. Shut up, Morty, you vindictive little turd! You shut up, you big female asshole! [ Warbles ] Hey, don't shove me! I didn't! You didn't what? What's your problem? What's yours? Shut up! You shut up! [ Rumbling ] Wh-whoa, whoa! What the [Echoing] hell, hell, hell, hell, hell? [ Echoing ] Oh, God. Oh, no. What did you guys just do? What did who do? What do you mean? Wait, what am I saying? [ Burps ] Were either of you guys uncertain about anything just now? Oh, man, I don't feel good. Am I me? Am I talking right now? I think so. Wait, who said that? All right, both of you just don't move. Don't speak, don't think. I have to check something. What'd you do, Morty? I'm gonna help Grandpa. I'll see if he needs help. What do you mean you're gonna help him? [ Scoffs ] I can help, too. What's happening, Grandpa? What's going on, Rick? Sh-sh-shut up. Oh, crap, are you kidding me? Two dots? This never needs to be more than one dot. The two of you made us uncertain! What are you talking about? What's that mean? English, please. English? Our time is fractured... You two somehow created a feedback look of uncertainty that split our reality into two equally possible impossibilities. W-we're exactly like a man capable of sustaining a platonic friendship with an attractive female co-worker. We're entirely hypothetical. But I thought there were infinite time lines? We're not on any time line, dummy. Look. [ Cat meows ] Oh, my God! Summer: Are those cats? I assume they're schrodinger's cats. Or, actually, I assume they both are and aren't, just like us. Is the world gone? Is the world gone? Where are mom and Dad? What about mom and Dad? Mom and Dad? Get your head out of your family's ass. The three of us are lost in a timeless oblmon. Your parents get to exist. They're probably lmng it up in some pointless, grounded story about their [Bleep] marriage. Jerry: Cold stone creamery is the best. What should we do with our remaining $20? You realize they sing no matter how much you tip? Whoa! Aaah! Holy [Bleep] What happened? I hit a deer. We... we have to tell the cops you were drmng. What? This is rum raisin! It's still alive. Well, do we... do I, uh, get, uh, a big rock, or...? It's not an armadillo, asshole. I thought that's what a man's supposed to say. It's not like I could've actually done it. If we were near a hospital, I could treat it, but I... I think we have to just... It's okay. This is just something that happens. And even if we were in a hospital, what could we do? You're a horse surgeon, not a deer surgeon. So...? Well, don't different animals... Require different levels of skill to keep alive? Oh, God. Get the deer in the car, Jerry. Yes, Beth. This is why you don't freeze time, you guys. It's incredibly irresponsible. And you did it so we could clean the house after a party? Look, there's no time to hold me accountable, Morty. Like, literally no time. Look around. Uncertainty is inherently unsustainable. Eventually, everything either is or isn't. And we've got about four hours to be "is." Or...? We isn't. All right, since this time crystal exists in both possibilities, and since it's impossible that I didn't nail this, I'm probably about to press this button in both possibilities at exactly the same time. How do you know... How do you know that... Whatever your asking me, the answer is I'm amazing. And away we go. [ Warbling ] Huh, what do you know. It's working. Ow, ow, ow! Oh [Bleep] What the hell is wrong with you two? I-I-I-I mean you four! Both: That hurt! That was painful. Good, I'm glad it was painful. You deserve it. I saw you. Y-you're both [Burps] all over the damn place. We've been split for 20 minutes and your lives are already scattered to the quantum [Bleep] wind? What the hell do either of you two have to be so uncertain about? Your brand of zit cream? Which chair to sit in while I do everything? Come on, spit it out! Well, you don't exactly make it easy, Rick. You make fun of me all the time... You're always picking on me... And now Summer's doing it... and now you got Summer to kiss your ass. Me?! What about you? You're just as mean to me because you're jealous... Could you get more excited to see me fail? Because you want Grandpa all to yourself! All right, all right, cool it. I see what's happening here. You're both young, you're both unsure about your place in the universe, and you both want to be Grandpa's favorite. I can fix this. Morty, sit here. Summer, you sit here. Now, listen. I know the two of you are very different from each other in a lot of ways, but you have to understand that as far as Grandpa's concerned, you're both pieces of sh1t. Yeah. I can prove it mathematically. Actually, l-l-let me grab my white board. This has been a long time coming, anyway. [ Tires screech ] Emergency! Wounded deer coming in. [ Air hissing ] Three. Excuse me, you can't be back here. I'm a certified horse surgeon, and this deer needs medical attention. Nurse, please move that snake. That's my nurse. And as a horse surgeon, I'm sure that you know that deer have much smaller, much more intricate organs. As a vet, I'm sure you know that a deer is closer to a horse than you are to a doctor. So let's save the measuring for when our dicks are out. It's time to save a life! Geez. [ Grunts, sighs ] That's odd. This deer's wounded. Uh, yeah, I was there. You don't have to rub it in. I mean it's been shot with a gun. Man: My gun. May I help you, sir? No, but you can stop helping this deer. I shot it before these two hit it with their car, and I followed them when they hauled it off. This deer belongs to me. [ Sighs ] We don't have time for this, okay? I need anaesthetic and deer saline. Look, I don't know what the law says about this, but I took an oath that I would let no animal come to harm. Except when sterilizing, aborting, or euthanizing them, or also when eating them at also any meal. I'm calling my lawyer. I hope for all our sakes you're as bad a surgeon as I am a hunter. In your dreams, bitch. Scalpel. So, in conclusion, you're both equally mercurial, overly sensitive, clingy, hysterical, bird-brained homunculi. And I honestly can't even tell the two of you apart half the time because I don't Go by height or age, I Go by amount of pain in my ass, which makes you both identical. All right, everything resolved? Everybody nice and certain about their position in my world. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. All right, perfect. Sit still. [ Burps ] Arms down. I'm gonna do this again. This time be like Grandpa. You mean drunk? What's that? You got something to say? No. And away we Go! And away we Go! Huh, that's weird. Huh, that's weird. [ Button clicking ] Oh, my God. What? Oh, my God. What? The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! What?! The son of a bitch is gonna kill me! What?! Diabolical, unfeeling sociopath. Don't you get it?! Don't you get it?! The other Rick isn't trying to merge us anymore. He thinks he can save his own skin by using the crystal to kill me. He probably figures it's [Belches] easier to eliminate one of the possibilities rather than merge them. [ Laughs ] I have to admit, it was always in the back of my mind, too. The difference is I would never do it, until now. Rick, what the hell are you doing? Saving our lives! After he takes me out, he's... He's gonna be coming for you. Who? Me! [ Gunshot ] Aah! Whoa! You see that? Get down! I told you, he's a psycho. He's lost it! Th-th-th-the time fracture must have made him crazy! I don't know what to do! Oh, crap! I don't know what to do! [ Rumbling ] [ Device beeps ] Oh, God, now there's three of them. We're outnumbered. Get in the cupboards. Wait, don't... don't do that. They'll know. Wait, wait. Think about getting in the cupboards, but don't really. [ Gunshots ] [ Screams ] Is this what you want, you sick [Bleep]?! You want to see children die?! You son of a bitch. You don't stop lmng until I say so! Michael. Who's this now? My lawyer. I'm here to notify you, ma'am, that in this county, any deer shot by a hunter is that hunter's property regardless of how far it runs or who intercepts it before it dies. It's called Brad's law. We can't make you stop the surgery, but at this point, you're performing it on venison. Actually, I've decided not to eat it. All this fear and conflict... I'm sure it's ruined the meat. I'm just gonna use the head for my rec-room wall. She normally works on horses. Jerry, if you're not gonna help, get the [Bleep] out of here. I will reach into heaven and yank your screaming deer soul back! Jesus. Shh, shh! I know where you are, you creepy old monster. I know how you think. Oh, is there where you think I'm going? You think I'm standing here? Well, maybe you're right. [ Morty grunts ] [ Rick groans ] Summer: Holy [Bleep] now what? Well, if all of me knocked out all the ricks, and you peed in all of your pants, doesn't that mean that we're all synchronized? Right. Okay. So, from now on, whatever we do, we have to be certain. Right. I think I'm certain we're effed in the "a." [ Cats meowing, purring ] Oh, God, my head. [ Groans ] What did you guys do? We put you in a dog crate because you were acting crazy and you caused another time fracture. You tried to kill yourself. O-only in self-defense. Myself tried to kill me first. Guys, I don't expect you to understand this, but time breaking twice means our problem is two times bigger and we've got half as much time to solve it. Well, actually, I do expect you to understand that. It's basic math. C-can somebody just let me out of here? If I die in a cage, I lose a bet. Well, is there some way you can prove you're not a threat to yourself and others anymore? Oh, for God's sake. All right, here. Give me the time crystal. Wh-what are you doing? Calling myself. Here, listen. It'll [Burps] probably Go to voicemail since, you know, I'm calling myself. Hello, Rick here. Don't fall for it. It's a bit. Just kidding! Ha, ha! You just got Ricked. You've reached Rick's voicemail. You know what to do. [ Beep ] Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. No hard feelings. I know you know I mean it, too. Take it easy. Whoa, damn! Look at this. I'm blowing up... Three new voicemails. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Listen, I'm sorry about earlier. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I heard this one. Hey, Rick. It's Rick. Hey, Rick, it's... You get the idea. [ Burps ] W-we're cool now. Okay, well, we're still not gonna let you out of this crate. Fine. I'll just do it myself. If you could get out that whole time, why didn't you? Because I waited until I was certain it was what I wanted to do, Morty. That's the difference between you and me. I'm certain, and you're a walking burlap sack filled with turds. You know, geez, Rick! Y-y-you're really tearing into me right now. You know, words hurt. Holy! A monster! Hey, you... hey, quit yelling. Quit yelling. What the [Bleep] Your time is all ripped up to hell! [ Warbles ] You broke your time twice. [ Sighs ] How did this happen? [ All speaking indistinctly ] Nevermind. Shut the [Bleep] up. Oh, damn. I'm from the fourth dimension. I can hear all of y'all. Now let's just see what we got here for a second. [ Groans ] Hey, damn it. Were you trying to use this to... Oh, see, you broke time, and you thought you could just stick it back together with this? How you think you gonna move time while you're standing in it, you dumbass three-dimensional monkey-ass dummies? Oh, way to Go, Rick. Yeah, Grandpa, way to Go. What, you're just gonna listen to this guy now? He's got a giant testicle for a head. He came here in a bubble. For all we know, he could be the David berkowitz of nutsackland. Shut up. Here, put these on. They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time. Y'all are just... Just... just negligent. See, now... Now look right here. Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on. We have them on. What are you talking about? Uh, we did. We're not wearing collars. Exactly. 'Cause you're being obstinate. [ Belches ] What? Put the damn collars on if you want to live. They're on right now. We did. They're on. All right, fine. Summer, Morty, put them on. [ Device beeps ] [ Warbling ] Yes, we're back! No more cats! We're back in certain time. Problem solved. No more cats! Oh, you did it! You fixed it. Yeah, I did. Now keep those collars on so you don't break your weak-ass time again. How long, exactly, do we have to wear these things? They're really embarrassing. Well, since you're going to time prison, I'd say you can keep them on forever. Time prison? Yeah. Well, I don't know where you expect me to think you got that crystal over there, but the only way your dumbass assin' ass asses could ever have on is if it was stolen. You stole a time-freezing crystal from testicle monsters?! I would've been happy to pay for it, s... [burps] Summer, but they don't exactly sell them at Costco. Besides, there's a larger lesson to be learned here. Get him! No, no, no, no! You better keep back! Man, this will turn your ass into a third-trimester fetus from 30 yards. [ Monitor beeping ] Mm. Isn't there a kitten somewhere that needs a manicure? That's right, Mrs. Smith. Give in to your anger. Neglect that deer. Honey, it's gonna be okay. These men are from the cervine institute of of elk, moose, deer, and stag. They can take this deer to a helicopter and fly it to the country's top deer surgeon on a wildlife reserve across the state border. Where your jurisdiction ends. I guess that's the end of that. There is just one more thing. According to this state's veterinarian statute, this animal can't be transferred until the current attending physician verbally confirms their inability to provide adequate care. You heard the man, horse doctor. You have to say you couldn't hack it. We did it! Uh-huh. No, Mother... no. Earth, dude. No, I'm talking about... Yeah, with the dinosaurs. No, if you get to the dolphin people, you gone too far. All right, man, I'll talk to you later. Okay. You know what they do to third-dimensional life forms in time prison? Same thing they do in every other prison, only forever. Why are you doing this? You think I want to be an omniscient immortal being transcending time and space my whole life? I got ambitions, man. Bringing you guys in is my ticket up. What if I told you there's a huge ticket up right behind you? You really think I'm that stupid? All right, hear me out on this. You're immortal, right, which means your life is infinite. Okay, well, then that means there's a 100% chance that you'll eventually do everything, including turning around to look behind you. I cannot argue that. [ Thud! ] Aaah! [ Squeals ] Oh, God, gross and weird! Chris! [ Splat! ] You killed my gun! Rick: Summer, Morty, take off your collars. What? What the hell are you doing? Good question. I suppose the answer is I'm not certain. Oh, no, what are you doing? I have no idea. I'm not sure. Stop it! [ Echoing ] Maybe I will, maybe I won't. I'm really uncertain about everything, even kicking your ass. List... hey! Tw... ow! But the... these arms are vestigial! [ Grunts ] Now, you poked me where an eye would've been about 6 million years ago. Summer: [ Echoing ] Come on, let's help Grandpa. Morty: [ Echoing ] Yes! I'm 100% not sure about anything! Yeah, totally uncertain. Beat his ass! Get him! Beat him up! Kick his ass, Rick! Die, Mother[Bleep]! Ow! I'm defeated. What's happening? Time is falling apart. We've got to get back to certainty quick. Give me your collars. Oh, man. Don't you have to fix, like, 30 of them? Morty, I have to fix three of them. And then there's 31 other versions of me that have to also fix three, for a total of 96. I'm not an idiot. I know how to be decisive. Now hand me that flat-head screwdriver. Now hand me that Phillips screwdriver. Actually, make it a flat-head. Actually, make it a Phillips. Oh, sh1t. Look, I know I was kind of a nuisance today. I know it's my fault we hit the deer. And I know you wanted to be the one to save it. Whatever. How petty would I have to be to care less about an animal's life than my own ego? Well, you'd have to be pretty petty. But you'd still be the woman I married. [ Car rattles ] Where are we going? One last stop. [ Tires squeal ] Where's the helicopter? There is no helicopter. And there is no cervine institute. But the top deer surgeon... I'm looking at her. Thanks for teeing me up like that. You better get moving. These lights are designed for basic ice-cream work. They're not gonna last all night. I need five minutes. [ Upbeat music plays ] Jerry, this was the most romantic weekend I've ever had. Thanks to cold stone creamery. You're welcome. Rick: Okay, collars are done. Put them on. We're out of time. It's ironic, huh? [ Beeping ] Huh? Wait a minute. Great. Rick! What's going on? The collar. Oh, the latch is broken. It won't latch closed around my neck. Oh, are you kidding me? Geez, what's going on? How come our collars aren't green? Obviously because someone doesn't know how to put his collar on, and one of me is stuck trying to help him. Don't blame this on me. You're the one that couldn't fix a latch. What are you talking about? It's not broken, Morty. I fixed it. Just put it on. It won't close. It's broken. Fine, bring it here. [ Groans ] Oh! Rick! Morty! [ Screams ] Oh, really, Morty? Well, I'm sorry. I'm not the one who's so [Bleep] uncertain about everything. You know what I'm certain of, Rick? I've really made up my mind about this. I never want to see you again! You're never gonna see anything again, you little dummy! You killed us! God damn it. [ Grunts ] ♪♪ Rick! Oh! Morty, where's your collar? I'll fix it. I dropped it. [ Beeping ] What the hell? What have you done to me, Morty? I'm okay with this. Be good, Morty. Be better than me. Oh [Bleep] the other collar! I'm not okay with this. I am not okay with this! Oh, sweet Jesus, please let me live. Oh, my God, I have to... I've got to fix this thing. Please, God in heaven. Please, God. Oh, lord, hear my prayers. [ Collar beeps ] Yes! [Bleep] You, God! Not today, bitch! Please, God, if there's a hell, please be merciful to me. [ Collar beeps ] Yes, I did it! There is no God! In your face! One dot, mother[Bleep] Yes! Oh, yes! All right, you know what I'm talking about. Oh, that was a close call. Oh, yeah! I'm gonna do the cabbage patch, Morty. Oh, yeah, do it. Check me out. I'm doing the cabbage patch. Do it right. I'm doing it, too. Do the cabbage patch. It's a classic dance. Do it. Do the dance. Oh [Bleep] look at that. Hey, wait a second, how come you guys took longer to get here? I don't know. I think, like, 1/64 of my collars didn't work. It's hard to keep straight now that I have 63 other memories of everything. Yeah. But I feel like one of the 64 ricks, like, sacrificed himself for me? Maybe? I think? Shut up, Morty. The last time you felt something, we all almost died. You little piece of sh1t. Beth: Hey, guys, we're home. Together: Mom! Dad! Uh, hold the phone. Where did you guys get those necklaces from? Uh, lady gaga, table for three. Am I right? Are you guys power rangers, but only on one small part of you necks? Hey, do those things need batteries? Were they included? Cleanup in the fruit aisle. Not in a homophobic way, though. They're just fruity necklaces is what I was saying. I'm gonna pee my pants! Somebody call the planet of "tron"! Doesn't feel so good, does it? We have three "tron" people over here. No, it doesn't. It hurts. Seriously, are these Halloween costumes? Are you going as motorcycles with green headlights instead of normal ones? Are you dogs? Robot dogs? [ Laughs ] Gosh, you guys are lame. Are those chokers from the '90s? What is this, a '90s nostalgia thing? Are you guys in that movie "the craft" with fairuza balk? [ Dramatic electronic music plays ] [ Warbling ] Hey, man, when the hell were you? Looking for you, asshole. I told you past the dinosaurs. You know how much time is past the dinosaurs? Half of all time! Come on, man. It's this way. Come on. Give me that thing. Speed it up. He can't be this far back. No, no, there he is. There he is. There he is. There he is. Stop, stop. So, that's the guy, huh? Yeah, that's him. Hey, man. Remember me? I got something for your ass. [ Grunting ] Don't... mess... with time! You don't [Bleep] with time! Mother[Bleep] [ Warbles ] [ Groans ] [ German accent ] I will mess with time. [ Whimpers ] I will mess with time. [ Shouting ] Man: Did you get any of that? Man: [ Italian accent ] It's a good show.Rick: Learning to fly this thing, Morty, is gonna be really liberating. You know, you're gonna be free to go on all kinds of errands for me. Cool. See that planet right there? Don't fly too close to that planet. Someone will come out and try to wash your windshield. [Ringtone plays] Hold on. [Cellphone beeps] Yeah? Yeah, I have it. Where do you want to meet? All right, cool. [Cellphone beeps] All right, Morty, lesson's over. We got some business to attend to a few light minutes south of here. Oh, you still use south in space? Whoa! Jesus, Jerry! What the hell are you doing here?! What are you talking about? We agreed a boy's father should be present when he's learning to drive. I guess I remember that. Wow. And you've just been back there this whole time? Amazing. Well, we don't have time to take him to earth, Morty. Head for 3924917. Cool! [Laughs] Looks like I'm coming along for an adventure! Yep. [Sighs] This is where we're going? Nope. This is. You can park in a handicap spot, Morty. Anything with less than eight limbs is considered disabled here. Well, look at this fella. Aren't you handsome? Thank you. [Chuckles] I'm Jerry. Oh, I know you are. Did you come here in a spaceship? I'm traveling with my son and father-in-law. W-wait. Are they coming? Oh, they'll be back soon. What?! I don't know how this works! Help me! What the hell?! I know, right? Oh, what the hell?! I know, right? Morty: Jerryboree!? You created a day care for my dad? Are you kidding? I wish I had this idea. Well, I did have this idea, but I wish I was the version of me that owned it. That guy's rich. Don't forget to check the reason for your drop-off. Trust me, Morty, I've heard stories from other Ricks. Jerrys don't tend to last five minutes off of earth. This is a totally unregistered cross-temporal asteroid. Here, they can romp and play with other Jerrys. He couldn't be safer. Hey, Morty, hang on to this. That number's your dad. If you lose it, we're not gonna be able to get him back. ♪ [Electricity crackles] ♪ Okay, wait here. I want to come with. Don't come with. It's boring. It's [Belches]... it's business stuff. What kind of business do you do in a garage? You know, this seems a little shady. Right, yeah, like nothing shady ever happened in a fully furnished office? You ever hear about Wall Street, Morty? Y-you know what those guys do in their fancy boardrooms? They take their balls and they dip them in cocaine and wipe them all over each other. You know, grandpa goes around, and he does his business in public, because grandpa isn't shady. Aw, crap. Hey, what's up? Hey, Rick! [Laughs] Here you go 3,000 flerbos. Do you have the weapon? C-can we please? This is my grandson, Morty. Oh, hi, Morty. I'm Krombopulos Michael. I'm an assassin. I buy guns from your grandpa. [Groans] Here. Go away. Ooh! Yeah, this looks deadly. So, this shoots antimatter? My target can't be killed with regular matter. Nice to meet you, Morty. Listen, if you ever need anybody murdered, please give me a call. I'm very discreet. You're g-giving him a card?! I have no code of ethics. I will kill anyone, anywhere children, animals, old people doesn't matter. I just love killing. You sell weapons to killers for money? [Groans] You've got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mind-set, Morty. It's more complicated out here. These are flerbos. Do you understand what two humans can accomplish with 3,000 of these? Uh, what? An entire afternoon at Blips and Chitz! Oh, this place is the best. It's got beer, games, prizes, and you can never tell what time it is. You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?! Yeah, sure, I mean, if you spend all day shuffling words around, you can make anything sound bad, Morty. Here, check this out. [Coin drops] [Whoosh!] Aah! [Breathing heavily] Roy, what's wrong? I had a nightmare. I was with an old man. He put a helmet on me. It's just a fever. Get some sleep. I don't want you missing school on Monday. [Bell rings] Man: I want you kids to look around you today and think about your future. Now is the time in your life when anything is possible. Announcer: Spiraling perfectly! It's gonna be caught by Roy Parsons! Roy Parsons is at the 20! Now he's at the 10! Nothing can stop Roy "the Rocket"! Touchdown! [Cheers and applause] I just think it's time to get realistic. Have you talked to my father about the carpet store? Roy? [Sighs] [Cellphone rings] Had we caught it sooner well, hindsight is 20/20, Roy. What's important is that we move quickly. [Monitor beeps] [Weakly] I'm not ready to die. You're not going to. Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Hey, thanks for the carpet, Roy. Man: Hey, Roy, you pulled those persian off-white shags for the clearance sale? Whoa. Sh sh1t! [Bones crack] Oh! [Beeping] Whoa! What the hell?! W-w-where am I?! What in the hell?! 55 years. Not bad, Morty. You kind of wasted your 30s, though, with that whole bird-watching phase. Where's my wife?! Morty, you were just playing a game. It's called "Roy". Snap out of it. Come on. I'm Morty. You're Rick. Hey! You sold a gun to a guy that kills people! Look at this you beat cancer, and then you went back to work at the carpet store? Boo! D-don't dodge the issue, Rick! Selling a gun to a hit man is the same as pulling the trigger! It's also the same as doing nothing. If Krombopulos Michael wants someone dead, there's not a lot anyone can do to stop him. That's why he does it for a living. Now excuse me. It's time to thrash your "Roy" score. You know, you could stop this killing from happening, Rick! You know, you did a bad thing selling that gun, but you could undo it if you wanted. Uh-huh, yeah, that's the difference between you and me, Morty. I never go back to the carpet store. Holy sh1t! This guy's taking Roy off the grid! [All gasp] This guy doesn't have a social security number for Roy! [All murmuring] Hi. I'm sorry. I think there was a misunderstanding.

This is a galactic federation outpost! Look, I don't have time to tell you my entire backstory, but grandpa and government don't get along. He saved my life. What? Huh?! Whoa! Are you Krombopulos Michael's target? W-what's your name? My kind has no use for names. I communicate through what you call "Jessica's feet" no, "telepathy". Oh, good job, Morty.

I don't think the gromflamites can track us now, but it looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Or, you know, if you still have that gun K. Michael dropped, we could finish the job and go home.

Don't waste your brain on those weirdos, Unity. They're no different from any of the aimless chumps that you occupy. They just put you at the center of their lives because you're powerful. And then because they put you there, they want you to be less powerful. Never gonna happen though, right? All: Never. Never. Back in a flash. ( door whooshes ) ( toilet flushes ) Best weekend ever, Rick. I agree, Rick. Let's see how long we can go. Hey, une. You got any more female president: Rick, forgive me for doing this in notes. I'm not strong enough to do it in persons. Delivery guy: I realize now that I'm attracted to you for the same reason I can't be with you. You can't change. Beggar: And I have no problem with that, but it clearly means I have a problem with myself. Newspaper vendor: I'm sure there's no perfect version of me. I'm sure I'll just unify species after species and never really be complete. Female president: But I know how it goes with us. I lose who I am and become part of you. Because in a strange way, you're better at what I do without even trying. Yours, and nobody else's, Unity. P.S., I don't know where those coal miners were before they were assimilated. You might want to get checked. Man: ( belches ) ( laughter ) ( door opens, closes ) Hey. Dad. ( clears throat ) I, um Jerry and I were looking for our weed whacker and found your subterranean lair and your alien prisoner, and he got away. And I know I sound like mom, but I can't sacrifice this whole family's safety just because I'm afraid you'll leave again, so no more alien prisoners and no more subterranean excavation without consulting us. Okay. Okay? "Okay" like you're gonna quietly teleport somewhere and never come back? No. It's your house. Grandpa Rick, what happened with Unity? Who? Oh, Unity. Yeah, well... I mean, honestly, we're talking about an entity that thrives on enslavement, you know? It's not cool. Fun's fun, but who needs it? I'll be in the garage.

I wanted to thank you for letting me live here all this time, so I'm treating the family to a vacation! Steve, you're so sweet. Thanks, uncle Steve! Best uncle ever. Look out, world. The smith family is going to paris! Summer: Yeah! Awesome! Rick, I don't like glowing rocks in the kitchen trash! Well, I don't like your unemployed genes in my grandchildren, Jerry, but life is made of little concessions. I -- you know what? You're gonna land on your feet, jer. Some company out there's gonna thank their lucky stars they hired my little brother. Who the [bleep] are you? My goofy brother, Steve. ( chuckles ) he's been living here almost a year now. Are you losing your mind? Hey, someone's been spending too much time around glowing rocks. Am I right? ( laughter ) ( screaming ) Oh, my god! Call an ambulance! Jerry: Oh, god! Steve! What the hell, Rick?! What the hell?! Will everybody just relax for a second? There's no such thing as an "uncle Steve." That is an alien parasite. ( screeches ) ( both gasp ) But I've known him my whole life. No, you haven't, Jerry. These telepathic little bastards, they embed themselves in memories, and th-then they use those to multiply and spread out, take over planets. It's -- it's disgusting. Steve wasn't real? He's a real piece of [bleep] This is a big one. Somebody probably tracked it in last week on the bottom of their shoe on a piece of alien fruit. Someone? Get off the high road, Summer. We all got pink eye because you won't stop texting on the toilet. But uncle Steve taught me how to ride a bike! No, "Steve" put that memory in your brain so he could live in your house, eat your food, and multiply. We could be infested with these things. ( belches ) so we got to keep an eye out for any zany, wacky characters that pop up. Ooh, whee! Whatever you want, Rick! We're here to help! Thanks, Mr. Poopybutthole. I always could count on you. ♪ ♪ All right. There's six of us, and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, and Summer. Maybe you got the first one in time, Rick! Can't afford to chance it. ( beep ) Dad, why does our house have blast shields? Trust me, Beth, you don't want to know how many answers that question has. Ooh, gosh, it feels claustrophobic! Reminds me of that time we all got stuck in the elevator together. Y-- remember that? After "the hulk" musical? ( grunting ) ( muzak playing ) Jerry, buttons don't work better if you hit them harder, and foam fists don't make you strong. I know. Friends make you strong. I watched the same musical you did. Why couldn't I bring my portal gun? ( winces ) Why did all the drinks have to be extra large? Oh, the hulk. I just got that. Just pee your pants. I did it the minute we got stuck. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, shame me. At least when I'm disgusting, it's on purpose. Oh, y'all, we're gonna be fine. I've always been here for you guys, and I always will be. ( chuckles ) somebody call for repairs? all: Yay! Cousin Nicky! It's me, cousin Nicky. I'm walkin' here! I mean, I'm not. I'm crouched in the elevator shaft, but hey, I'm walkin' here! ( laughter ) It's true. We really do get into some crazy situations as a family, mostly when we're cooped up like this. Hey, maybe Mr. Poopypants is right. L-let's get some fresh air. Come on, cousin Nicky. You heard Rick. We have to stay quarantined until we know that there's no more of these things. I hear you, Morty. Back in brooklyn, we got a sayin' -- "we're walkin' here!" ( laughter ) Nicky, get -- Oh! ( gasps ) ( groaning ) what the...? Cousin Nicky was a parasite?! Six, Morty! There's supposed to be six of us! If there's seven, then that means somebody's not real. But how did you know it was Nicky? I guessed. That's why I aimed for his shoulder. So we can't trust any of our memories now? Nicky was the reason we found that old nazi submarine. Did that not even happen? Well, of course it happened. Now that I possess the mighty staff of rah-gubaba, the world will tremble before the fourth reich! This is the last time I ask you for help on my history final, Rick. Hey, we got a word for nazis back in brooklyn, pal. I'm comfortable being called a nazi. You think there's some other word that will hurt my feelings? Yeah. Think before you talk [bleep] Rah-gubaba, help me kill america! all: Mr. Beauregard! After due consideration, I have elected not to retire. all: Yeah! Oh, thank god! Now, I believe someone has a final exam to attend. Set a course for Morty's high school. Perhaps I'm biased, but if that story never happened, then I wouldn't still be the family butler. ( chuckles ) dare to dream. Wait. And if Mr. Beauregard wasn't our butler, it's safe to say the family'd be in a hell of a lot of trouble. ( laughter ) no! Don't flashback! You're just gonna make more swelling. Don't worry, Jerry. Just relax. We called the fire department. You know they won't come here anymore. ( grunting ) ( all gasp ) Syeerahve!d. Is yeah! Yeah! Yeah! ( Jerry laughs ) Oh, whee! I guess I take back what I said about british cuisine. ( laughter ) ( laughter ) Take that, Summer! We're trying to sleep. I don't want to go to the dance alone. Then perhaps you shouldn't. Aww. Mr. Beauregard. Shall we, master Morty? We shall. Oh, wait, don't leave without letting photography raptor take a picture. ( raptor screeches ) ( camera shutter clicks ) ( laughter ) Everybody stop remembering! These parasites are like bed bugs, and every flashback is another mattress. Look! There's only supposed to be six people in this house. But there's always been 10. No! Uh, the fact that I wrote this number down means that there's four parasites. You sure about that, Rick? Begging your pardon, master Rick, but I seem to recall a great deal of confusion surrounding that number. All right, there's six of us. ( belches ) and that's it. Me, Morty, Jerry, Beth, Mr. Poopybutthole, Frankenstein, sleepy gary, photography raptor, Mr. Beauregard, and Summer. Uh, dad, that's like 10 people. 6, 10, what's the difference? I just love the number 6 for no reason! Where's my pencil at? Here, Rick! Use me! Oh, thanks, pencilvester! Yeah, I-I g-- I guess that is what happened, but I-I don't get why I would do that. Everybody makes mistakes, Rick. Why do you think I have one of these? ( laughter, camera shutter clicks ) That's it. Photos. Hard evidence. You're not in any of my photos, Mr. Poopybutthole. Well, what do you know about this? You're not in any of mine. All I have are pictures of me and my friends from school. What? What teenage girl has pictures of her family? It's not like we're mormon or dying. I will admit it's suspicious that Summer's only friend is a magic ballerina lamb that we've never seen. Summer! Tinkles! It's past my bedtime.

Tinkles is real. That means so am I. Sorry, Summer. Man, I'm sorry, Summer. I was on the wrong side of the pitchfork on this one. Okay, look, we shouldn't need evidence or logic to know who's family and who isn't. I know who the smiths are. I've known Beth since high school. And her husband, sleepy gary, is hands down my absolute best friend. Thanks, Jerry. Beyond that, no offense to any of you, but all bets are off. Look, I'm not used to being this unsure for this long. I'm just gonna aim for shoulders starting with the weird girl. Aah! Grandpa Rick! Hold still, "Summer." Rick, that is my daughter. Oh, yeah? Well, what if you just think that, sleepy gary? I've known you for 15 years. Don't make me hurt you. Rick, these are our family and friends, the people we barbecue with. Have you forgotten the barbecue? Wait, why would you want me to -- You're one of them, aren't you? Rick. You love those barbecues, Rick. You love them. Hai! Remember it, Rick? Shut up, hamurai! Shut up, amish cyborg! What is this? '90s conan? all: Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. Remember the barbecue. ( chatter ) You know what, pencilvester? It took me my whole life to realize it, but I love barbecuing. You're good at it, Rick. Watch me, baby. I'm like tom cruise from, um, "cuisine" or w-whatever that movie's called where he makes drinks. Yeah, check me out. I'm like tom cruise from "cuisine." ( chuckles ) yeah. Is that what it's called? "cuisine"? Wow! Hey, everybody. Let's give it up for the grillmaster Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! ( all chanting "Rick" ) Wait. ( breathing heavily ) Noooooo! Shoot. Now look. It's like a "where's waldo?" page. Can you find me? Check out all these zany characters. We'll be right back after these messages. I think you should put down the gun and we should get you to a doctor. What do you say we take down these blast shields? all: Yeah. I can't do that, sleepy gary. All right, everybody listen to me. I don't know if any of you guys are real, but this house has been infested with fake loved ones that spread through fake memories, and our planet will be destroyed if they get out. ( grunts ) But, Rick, even you have to admit you do tend to overreact to stuff. You guys, we got to hurry. I just got back from walmart. They're selling nintendo 3ds systems for $149.99 on sale, plus every time you buy one, you get a $50 gift card. Brings the total price down to $110 after tax. Now, listen, we can flip those sons of bitches for 230 bucks apiece easy! They're all limited-edition "zelda" ones. Hurry! Hurry! Come with me! We can be rich, and we also all get to keep one and we can play nintendo games! Nintendo, give me free stuff. Okay, yes, I definitely remember doing that, but also, I would never do that. Don't overreact, Rick. Sleepy gary, a word? Sure, Jerry. Rick, keep a level head, okay? 'Cause I'll tell you a secret about Frankenstein -- He's actually Frankenstein's monster. Sleepy gary, m-my head is filled with memories of our friendship. I'm convinced that you're Beth's husband and I'm your friend, but if those memories can't be trusted, then... Jerry, just say it. Sleepy gary, how do we know I'm real? Jesus, Jerry. No, you're real. Hey, look at me. Now, I don't know which way is up out there, but I know us, and you're real, Jerry. Remember our vacation? They're filming that new "star wars" movie down the coast. Should we check it out? Sure. Why not? Maybe we'll see Chewbacca. I'd like that. ( moaning ) What are we doing? I don't give a damn what else happens out there. You and I are going to survive this. Okay. Hey, we agreed. Never in the house. That's a cool watch there, Rick. Can I check it out? Uh, no thank -- ( grunts ) Okay. Trying to figure out how to lower the blast shields, huh? Anybody here think it's suspicious that a lot of people in here can't wait to get out of here? Ah, you're paranoid, Rick. You've been paranoid since 'nam. So, what are you gonna do when you rotate back to the world, Frankenstein? Shi-i-i-i-t. I'mma bust a -- ( grunts ) No! Get out of my head, parasite! No! Drop it. Give me the gun, Frankenstein! ( indistinct shouting ) Give it back! Yeah! ( applause ) Frankenstein! ( breathing heavily ) Is anyone here even real? Am I the only real person on earth?! Reverse giraffe: maybe. Or maybe, just maybe, we're all real. You know me. I'm reverse giraffe. I have a short neck and legs. I went to college with hamurai. Hai! I saved ghost in a jar's life in vietnam. Boo rah! And, Beth, how many times have I been a shoulder for you to cry on? ( sighs ) too many. Okay, so maybe we're just all fake. That don't make no sense! Or maybe there's only one deceiver here -- The person that keeps telling us the path to salvation is being held prisoner and mistrusting each other. Hey, don't blame me! I tried to shoot Summer 10 minutes ago! I know we all have beloved memories of Rick, but are we really supposed to believe that a mad scientist inventor with a flying car just showed up on our doorstep after being gone for years? Yeah, you know, he does have a lot of really weird, made-up sounding catchphrases. Wubba lubba dub dub! Ricky ticky tavi, beyotch! And that's the wa-a-a-a-y the news goes. Hit the sack, jack. Uh-oh! Somersault jump. Aids! And that's why I always say shum shum shlippedy dop! Grassss tastes bad-ah. No jumpin' in the sewer. Burger time! Rubber baby baby bunkers! Lick, lick, lick my balls! ( laughs ) yeah! Say that all the time. ( all muttering ) That's a fake-ass catchphrase right there. Yeah, don't forget his incredibly vague back story. Beth, I'm your father! Oh, are you, dad? Are you? Rick, if you want to prove you're real, just do what any of the rest of us would do and -- and -- and open the blast shields and let us the hell out of here! Why don't you make me, implausibly naive pubescent boy with an old jewish comedy writer's name? Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! woman: In your face! Give me the gun. I'm not doing this in front of pencilvester. Bring him to the garage. ( all cheering ) You listen to me, you son of a bitch parasite scum. We could either do this the easy way or the hard way. You know, y-y-y-- do you want to live? Then open the blast shield doors. Shut up, Morty, you brainwashed, little turd that might not even be real because I'm brainwashed, too. You know, Rick, this isn't easy for us. You know, w-we all remember you as a friend. Oh, oh, oh, really? Well, I remember you as a whiny, little piece of [bleep] Morty! Oh -- oh, yeah? Yeah!

Do it, mother[bleep] Pull the [bleep] trigger! ( screeches ) Oh, wow. Baby wizard was a parasite? He set me up with my wife. ( screeches ) What the hell? I figured it out, Rick!

We got a lot of friends and family to exterminate. ( grunts ) ( screaming ) Everybody remain calm! This is gonna take some explaining. We need to kill everyone that we can only remember fondly. Who's got a bad memory about mrs. Refrigerator? I-I-I-I -- everyone has bad memories of me. You remember that one time? ( screaming ) Ooh, man, we couldn't stop screaming. Uh, roller coasters aren't bad, mrs. Refrigerator. They're thrilling. And you've been a perfect companion to me my entire life. The jig is up! ( whimpering ) get me out of here. Get me out of here! Aah! ( screeching ) ( all gasping ) Oh [bleep] Everybody back! If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear. So what about Summer? Why am I always your go-to?

Does -- d-does that scan? Oh, I-I get it. It's a play on "the butler did it." Thanks, ghost in a jar. You always were good at pointing out potentially obscure comedy.

Oh, dear giant head, we apologize for that discussion. It will never happen again. Oh, dear-- Oh, dear giant head... [All praying] Sir, we started picking up on a garbled signal. We're decrypting it now. Head: We asked them to show us what they got, and they did. Now we'll see which of them has got the most. 24 hours, 5 planets, 5 songs. But in the end, there can only be one... Planet music! All participation is involuntary. Disqualified and losing planets are disintegrated by plasma ray. Uh, it's probably a bad time to mention it, but any astronauts you guys had in orbit are definitely dead. Head: Welcome back to "Planet Music"! First up, let's hear the latest song from planet Parblesnops', The Greeby Bobes! Show me what you got! Hold it, hold it. Stop. Music isn't about competition or captivity. If you love music, you love freedom. Let these worlds be free! Please! Disqualified. [Buzzer] There's one every season. Moving on to planet Arboles Mentirosos.

We've got six hours to come up with a song! Genius happens in the moment, Morty. Well, can we at least go get our family? You know, so we can take them-- With u-- With us if we lose? That's planning for failure, Morty. Even dumber than regular planning. Balls. Morty, Morty, stop. Listen. There's only so much charge left in this thing. If we portal home from here and back, we're not gonna have enough charge left to get off world. Get it? What?! Yeah. [Burps] You see? I try to shelter you from certain realities, [burps] Morty, because if I let you make me nervous, then we can't get schwifty. Stop saying it like it's a thing! You made it up! Hey, Morty, could you lick my... Balls, balls... Rick, cut it out! It's not funny, Rick! I've seen enough. These guys are one-hit wonders. And what's your plan, general? We still have the nuclear option. On my word, we can launch a missile at every one of those heads in the sky. Our planet's held captive on a live game show, and your solution is to shoot the audience? You can put your faith in nukes if we get through this, general. Until then, I'll put mine in Rick and Morty. "Get Schwifty" was a jam. Hello? Yes, sir, yeah. Eh, thank you, sir. Thank you. He says he's proud of what we're doing and hopes we have a great ascension festival! Happy ascension! All: Happy ascension! We should pack up and leave town now. I think it's inspiring that our community is coping with fear in a way that involves a festival and homemade ice cream. If you'd stop being such an Evangelical atheist, you might start enjoying yourself. Whoa! Look at you! You're wearing the hat and everything! Here's yours! Mom, do you mind if I cook dinner tonight? Yeah, sure. Wait. What? I love you guys. You gave me life. And it's the will of the many heads that all children honor their parents. Dinner sounds nice. Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Summer, are you coming to the ascension? Father, can we please go to the ascension? Sure! Let's go to the ascension. Wh-wh-what is it?

Ice, I don't want to be a negative Nelly or anything, but [burps] if Morty doesn't come back with my portal gun and I eat it out there, it's, uh, you know, kind of your problem, too. Pfft! I ain't worried about no earth blowing up, man. What? Why not? Yo, this is why. What the [bleep] you can turn into ice? My story begins at the dawn of time in the faraway realm of alphabetrium. There, every being is a letter of the alphabet. But I was frozen and exiled to the cosmos by my elders as punishment for not caring enough about anything. Earth is just one of my many stops on a lifelong journey with no destination. So you better believe I don't care if it blows up, because I'll just be ice floating through space, like a comet. Take it from me, ice, [burps] you can't just [burps] float around space not caring about stuff forever. Pfft. Man, watch me. Good luck, Rick. Okay, things are getting out of hand.

Why-- why-- I believe I can access the history of Rick's gun and help you get back to him. But can you help me get to my family? You know, at-- at my house? Is your intention to abandon Rick using his own portal gun? In bird culture, this is considered a dick move. All of Rick's moves are dick moves! What-- What am I eating? Wh-what is this, bird-- birdseed? It is random debris. I found it in my carpet. I don't know what humans eat. You know what this human eats. Don't be gross, Tammy. Bird [bleep]. Tammy, gross. Birdperson, you always stick up for Rick, but he doesn't care about anyone but himself. He doesn't think about the consequences of anything he does.

Morty, suppose you could retrieve your family from Earth but had to abandon Rick. I could give your loved ones shelter on birdworld, even jobs, possibly as worm ranchers.

And then we showed up here, and I wasn't like, "Whoa, this is unexpected. This is not what I was expecting, Morty. What a perplexing mystery this is." All right, all right. We're inside the battery. I get it. You don't have to bust my balls. Huh, this isn't right. This pipe's supposed to be sending 20 terawatts of juice up to the engine, Morty. [Computer beeps] Instead we've got... zero? Now what are these people doing? W-w-w-whoa, people? [Groans] It's time for some hands-on engine repair. All right, Morty, hold on to something. Whoa! Holy crap! I thought we were inside your car battery, Rick. T-t-this is like a whole p-planet or something. Thanks, Morty. I'm pretty proud of this bad boy. Check it out. [Keypad beeps] I put a spatially tessellated void inside a modified temporal field until a planet developed intelligent life. I then introduced that life to the wonders of electricity, which they now generate on a global scale. And, you know, some of it goes to power my engine and charge my phone and stuff. You have a whole planet sitting around making your power for you? That's slavery. It's society. They work for each other, Morty. They pay each other. They buy houses. They get married and make children that replace them when they get too old to make power. That just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Ooh-la-la, someone's gonna get laid in college. Anchor: It appears we are being revisited by the alien known as Rick, who once gave our world the gift of gooble box technology, which, when stomped on, generates electricity, powering our homes and businesses, improving our daily lives, while safely removing the dangerous waste power to a special disposal volcano. But why has Rick returned? And what will he say when he hears the big news? Let's find out. You need to tell these people they're in a battery, Rick. It's messed up. There's caterers down there. Th-th-they're setting up chafing dishes. Would you relax, Morty? There's nothing dishonest about what we're doing. Now slap on these antennae. These people need to think we're aliens. What? Why? Obviously [burps] you really [burps] know nothing about car repair. [Fanfare plays] Wait for the ramp, Morty. They love the slow ramp. Really gets their dicks hard when they see this ramp just slowly extending down. [Cheering] Greetings! [Creatures chanting, "Rick! Rick!"] Morty, you got to flip them off. I told them it means "Peace among worlds." How hilarious is that? [Creatures cheering wildly] Rick: Coming through. Two real aliens walking through here. Rick, our alien friend. Uh, Mr. President, um, couldn't help but notice that you were having problems generating power. That's correct. [Chuckles] We've evolved. Our most brilliant scientist, Zeep Xanflorp, has developed a source of energy that makes gooble boxes obsolete. [Straining] I would love to see it. [Bleep] you. What did you say to me?! "[Bleep] you." Y-you told me it means "much obliged". Oh. Right. Uh, b-blow me. No, no, no. Blow me. Zeep, you have an honored guest from beyond the stars. I said 12 quantum stabilizers, not 11. Fix it or it's your ass. Chris, I'm in the middle of something. Zeep, is Rick-- The alien. Rick the alien. Rick the alien... Really? You're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilization. Your people have a holiday named Ricksgiving. They teach kids about me in school. I dropped out of school. It's not a place for smart people. Ohhhh, snap! Listen to me, you arrogant little-- [Chuckling] R-Rick was hoping to see your new energy source. I think he could learn a lot from you, Zeep. Fine. It's hard for people to grasp, but inside that container is an infinite universe with a planet capable of generating massive amounts of power. I call it a miniverse. [Coughs] Dumb [coughs] name. Excuse me? [Clears throat] Nothing. I mean, it's hard for us to comprehend all this. Would it be possible for us to get some kind of tour of your miniverse from the inside? This isn't a [bleep] chocolate factory. I don't have time. Didn't you say time goes more slowly in the miniverse relative to the real world? Yes, Chris. Thanks for reminding me of that. Great president. All right, let's go. Whoa-oh! Hold on to something. I put an unbounded vacuum inside a temporal field until a world developed. I then introduced the people of this world to the wonders of electricity in the form of a device I call a flooble crank. Zeep: What they don't know is that 80% of every crank's energy output gets channeled out of the miniverse to be used by us. No more gooble boxes. Rick: I got to tell you, Zeep, with no disrespect, I really think what you're doing here is unethical. It's not cool. What?! Y-y-you got the people on this world slaving away [burps] making your power. I mean, that's what I call slavery. No, no, no, they work for each other in exchange for money, which they then-- Well, that just sounds like slavery with extra steps. Eek barba dirkle, somebody's gonna get laid in college. Rick, a word? What the hell was that? I know. "Eek barba dirkle"? That's a pretty [bleep] up "ooh-la-la". No, what are you doing telling this guy that his miniverse is unethical? Do you not see the hypocrisy here? Holy crap. You're right, Morty. Hypocrisy. Somewhere on this planet, there's got to be an arrogant scientist prick on the verge of microverse technology, which would threaten to make Zeep's flooble cranks obsolete, forcing Zeep to say microverses are bad, at which point he'll realize what a hypocrite he's being, his people will go back to stomping on their gooble boxes, and you and I will be on ice cream street, baby! Eating that mother[bleep] ice cream! Slurping, slurping, slurping it up. Wh-wh-why are you making that face? Holy [bleep]! It's me. I've convinced the people of this planet that I'm a traveler from another world. You don't think that's over[Burps]doing it a little? I mean, you could achieve the same effect with a pair of-- Never mind. You know what? I shouldn't be so critical. I'm an alien. Places, please. We're about to land. [Coughs] Too fast.

And if you continue to turn your flooble cranks, I will bring you other great alien advancements. Hey, uh, let me ask you something. Yes? Any of your, uh, scientists working on anything new? All of them. That's their job. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I mean, like, energy-wise. Anyone working on, say, a little universe in a box? How do you know about that? It's top secret. Zeep: So remember-- a crank a day is not nearly enough. [Laughs] Crank it. I told them this means "Peace among worlds". How hilarious is that? Re-really funny, Zeep. Hey, Zeep, the fake president of your fake world has something fake important to show you. It's not much now, but once I learn to accelerate the temporal field, I'll be able to interact with any sentient life that evolves and introduce them to the wonders of electricity via a pulley-based device I call a blooble yank. But what they won't know is-- You'll be taking most of their energy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. [Burps] It's show [Burps]time. You do realize this will make the flooble crank obsolete? This is wrong, Kyle. What you're doing is wrong. You're basically-- This is slavery. You're talking about creating a planet of slaves. [Burps] Told you, Zeep. Oh, they won't be slaves. They'll work for each other and pay each other money. That just sounds like slavery with ex... tra... steps. What? Wait a minute. Did you create my universe? Is my universe a miniverse? Microverse! Uh, teenyverse. Ugh! You b*st*rd! Much obliged. What the hell is happening? This is healthy, trust me. You're my battery, mother[bleep]. [Groans] That's all you are. I made you. Your microverse sucks! And your miniverse is the size of a [bleep] lobster tank! It's whack! Are they not really aliens? Nah, they're just a couple of crazy, wacky scientists, you know? So he made a universe, and that guy is from that universe. And that guy made a universe. And that's the universe where I was born. Where my father died. Where I couldn't make time for his funeral because I was working on my universe. I made you! [Laughs] Yeah. Science, huh? Ain't it a thing. You know, one time, Rick sh-- accidentally shot his laser pistol right through my hand. You know, I mean, like, old-lady science, you know? She's a real-- You got to hang on tight, you know?

When I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna smash it to pieces with you in it. Yeah, well, when I get out of this teenyverse, I'm gonna get out of the surrounding miniverse and then the microverse around that, and guess what? Don't make things worse, Rick! Uh, he's not gonna destroy your universe. You know, we-- We need it to start our car. That's what you used my universe for? To run your car? Yeah, but don't flatter yourself. There's always AAA, you [bleep] [bleep]sucker! What's he doing? What's he crafting? I can craft stuff, too, pal! Just like I crafted your reality! You crafty son of a-- Ow! I crafted the guy that created the planet you're standing on! Yeah, and I made the stars that became the carbon in your mother's ovaries! I didn't ask to be born! All right, that's it! I'm out. I-I'm gonna go into the wilderness, and I'm gonna make a new life for myself among the tree people. It can't be worse than this. Rick: Sure. Okay, Morty. Just be back before sundown or the tree people will eat you. That's a myth! W-w-why are you trying to start a myth? It's a prehistoric planet, Morty. Someone has to bring a little culture. And it certainly can't be someone whose entire culture powers my brake lights! [Sirens wailing] Go, go, go! Oh, my God. Oh, God. What are we going to do now? Female voice: I am unable to destroy this army. To clarify, I am quite able to destroy this army, but you will not permit it. Correct. You also refuse to authorize emotional countermeasures. If you're talking about the melting ghost babies, yes, please, no more of that. [Warble] Confirmed. I am currently constructing a security measure in compliance with your parameters. But I do want to say you are not making this easy. You know you're kind of a dick, right?

Look, I don't care what it takes. You two are putting aside your bull[bleep], and you're working together to get us back home. No can do, Morty. I just can't. I just don't see how I can-- Ro ro dah no gah! You're smart. You'll figure it out. [Guns cocking] You have 10 seconds to get out of the ship! 10, 9... All right, not bad. I guess you're an okay proto recombinator. I've certainly seen worse ionic cell dioxination. If this works, drinks are on me. If drinks are on you, you're gonna need a second mortgage on that tower. I'm an alcoholic. Opium addict. [Both laugh] All right, okay, okay, okay, wrap it up. You guys are the [bleep] worst! Your gods are a lie! [Bleep] you, [bleep] nature, and [bleep] trees! Yes! You did it! Yes! Hey, uh, how about that drink? Sure, I just need to go grab my wallet from inside my ship. Isour wallet in your ship? That's where the transporter is, too, so why don't we come with? It's cool. I'll be back in a sec. You know how long a second can take in a microverse? Oh! Run, Morty! That asshole's willing to risk everything he cares about just to defeat me! He's psychotic! [Both pant] Morty, hop on my back. Why? Go, go [Burps] Sanchez ski shoes. Aaaaaah! ...Eight... [Panting] Aaaah! Oof! [All grunting] Hold still. [Grunts] Oh, hey, guys. I just finished cooking us a feast. Aaaah! Holy-- You monster! Whoa. Bad tour. ...seven... [Elevator bell dings] Hey, you got to sign out. Nothing you do matters! Your existence is a lie! If that were really true, then... I'm here to see Ron Mendleson. Third floor. Would you like to go to dinner with-- Uh, no. [Both panting] You may have created this universe, Rick, but I live in it. [Bleep] What are we gonna do, Rick? We're so screwed. He's gonna get to the ship and smash the microverse, and then he's gonna kill us! Quick, Morty, you've got to turn into a car. What?! A long time ago, I implanted you with a subdermal chip that could call upon dormant nanobots in your bloodstream to restructure your anatomy and turn you into a car. Oh, my God! Concentrate, Morty. Concentrate and turn into a car, Morty. [Grunts] Never mind. Here's a taxi. Get in. It's fine. ...six... Hey, Zeep. Huh? Happy Ricksgiving, biiiiiitch. Aaah! We did it, Morty. Now let's get out of here and destroy this whole universe. Excuse me? ...five-- Sir? [Spiders hiss] Holy hell. Sir! [Tires screech] Hold you fire! [Spider snarls] What's going on? Female voice: I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government. Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace. We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption. Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs. What do we do about the space car? Leave it alone. I mean, what did it really do, anyways? Kill a guy and paralyze his buddy? [Chuckles] Not a bad trade for spider peace. All right, that's it. Move out! [Laughs] I love this spider! Female voice: Summer is safe. All right, I get it. Rick! [Thunder crashes] Don't do it. You quit school, but you still got some learning to do. [Both groan] Aah! Unh! [Snorts, spits] Class dismissed. Geez. [Bottles clatter] You all right? Uh-huh! What are you doing, Rick? I'm pretty sure the battery's dead. Oh, you think so, huh, Morty? Well, let's see. [Engine turns over] Hey, wait-- huh? I don't get it. Of course you don't. But Zeep did. He knew that once I got back to my car, one of two things was gonna happen-- I was gonna have to toss a broken battery, or the battery wouldn't be broken. Peace among worlds, Rick. Jesus. Yeah. Listen to that baby purr. You were right, Morty-- We really just needed to be honest with those guys. All right, here we go. Thank y-o-o-ou. See, Morty? This is what it's all about. This is why we do what we do. Uh-huh. Ew! What the hell? Jesus! There's flies in my ice cream. Presidential decree-- All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs. What the [bleep] did you do, Summer?! It was your ship! Your stupid ship did it! Don't blame my ship! It melted a child! My ship doesn't do anything... It killed it itself! ...unless it's told to do something! We almost died! I don't want to hear it, Summer! [Shouting indistinctly] Your boobs are all hanging about, and you ruined ice cream with your boobs out. And don't even try to deny it, either. Morty: [Groans] [Car alarm chirps] [Engine revs, students scream] [Alarm blaring, horn honking] Did you get any of that? It's a good show.What's new at school? Nothing. Nothing! Oh, uh, one of the lunch ladies died. They found her in the gym with, like, two holes in her neck and all the blood drained out of her. Good lord! Who does something like that? Obviously a vampire. W-w-where's the pepper? Wait, what?! Vampires are real?! Yes, Summer, vampires are real. Who knew? Oh, right, all humanity, for hundreds of years, now. Yeah, Summer, it's a big universe. Get used to it. R-right, Rick? Well, what are we going to do?! We're gonna live our lives until we die. Possibly by vampire. More likely auto accident or heart disease, but possibly vampire. Grandpa Rick, couldn't you, like, use your superknowledge to turn yourself into a teenager and come to our school and help us hunt the vampire down? Um -- wow. Yeah, pretty specific pitch, Summer. I probably could turn myself into a teenager and hang out in the zit-covered, hormone-addled, low-stakes assworld that is high school. But here's my reverse-ask -- why in the [Bleep] would I ever do that, ever? And how dare you even ask me that? And why aren't you more ashamed of yourself? Dad! Be ashamed of yourself, sweetie. Jerry! Do you know what you just said to our daughter? Sor-ry! I wasn't paying attention. To a conversation about vampires?! Clearly, I didn't know it was about vampires, because I wasn't paying attention, which you would know, if you ever paid attention to me! Oh, here we go, right to the victim role. Am I a victim, Beth, or am I married to a mean, unfair monster that always hurts me?! Jesus Christ! Will you fix your marriage or get a divorce already? Well, we tried a couples' therapist. That's earth therapy. You might as well ask a horse to fix a merry-go-round. I mean, he'll try his best, but mostly, he's just gonna get horrified. I know about a place off-planet with a 100% success rate. Well, we want to make it work, if we can. It's just -- then it's settled. No need to pack. Oh! Let's go, go, go, go! [Door opens, closes] Do you think mom and dad are, you know, gonna get a divorce? I think it's okay to dream, Morty. I'm gonna go make some wooden stakes. ♪ I booked you for a two-day intensive at nuptia four, the galaxy's most successful couples' counseling institute. They could save the marriage of a dog and a bar of dark chocolate. They could save the marriage of a p0rn star and a p0rn star. Well, I know I'm ready to try whatever it takes. Which clearly implies that I'm not. It's not a competition, Beth. Oh is that how you're gonna try to win, by implying I'm competitive? If the shoe fits. My shoe fits up your ass. You wish! Okay, have fun. See ya Thursday! Oh! Jerk. Don't insult my father. He's the reason our kids are only half-stupid. Ha! You just called yourself -- oh. Beth and Jerry Smith? Yes. I'm glaxo slimslom. Welcome to nuptia four. Your marriage can rest easy now. Jerry, go ahead and sit there and put this on. This machine isolates the part of the subject's brain containing all perceptions of its romantic partner. And we will now render Jerry's perception of Beth with artificial biological life. [Growl] Interesting. What the hell is that?! Take that back! You do not think that about me! I didn't do anything! They scanned it out of my brain. Can I take it back? There's nothing to regret. We're dealing with unconscious, unhealthy thoughts. Beth. Now, we scan for Beth's perceptions of Jerry. Scan hard. He's dead to me. Everything's dead to you. What? Nothing. [Whimper] Read it and weep, bitch. [Crying] Does everybody see what I mean? I think we all see what you both mean. [Bell rings] Any leads on the vampire? No, Summer! I mean, you know, I think it might be time that we just l-let it go. Oh, so, now, you're too cool for this, just because grandpa Rick is? It's not that, it's just that the universe is a little too big to care about something so small. Aah! What up, my helsings? Who wants to hunt a vampire? Ha ha ha! Rick? How -- how did you -- Yeah, I got bored and then, I remembered, this morning, how I blew Summer off, and I thought, "hey, why are you such a grumpy douche, Rick? Go to the garage, transfer your mind into a younger clone of yourself, and get embroiled in some youthful hijinks, what's the bfd?" So here I am. I'm tiny Rick! O-o-okay. Well, it's good you're here, Rick. I was pretty sure we didn't have what it takes to deal with a bloodsucker on our own. Don't short-sell yourself, Summer. You got everything it takes. But it'll still be fun to do this as a [Bleep] team, mother[Bleep] tiny Rick! Yeah! Oh, my God, Toby Matthews! Hey, Toby. I'm tiny Rick. I'm new. Hey oh -- go easy on me. Ha ha. Just kiddin'. I like your straightforward style and that lab coat's pretty cool. Summer. He knows my name! Why wouldn't he? You're great! But, listen, just be careful. We can't rule anybody out as the vampire, not even the dreamboats. Stop, tiny Rick. Huntin' a vampire with my grandkids! [Bleep]! Tiny ri-I-ck! Glaxo: The next step is to watch your mythologues interact together and, uh -- big surprise -- it's never pretty. [Laughter] Here we have garrrh and zharbidar gloompfschs, or, should I say, here we have the way garrrh and zharbidar perceive each other. [Roaring] [Chuckling] As we can all see, this is hardly the real garrrh and zharbidar. Which is good, because the relationship in their heads is not only ugly, it's unsustainable. [Beep] [Roar] [Growling] You may already be learning something important -- all of these relationships are different, none of them are real, and none of them work. We are not the monsters we sometimes see each other as, because we are real and we are functional. That's what makes us better than them. We can find solutions. We can adapt. We can communicate. [Growl] And, most importantly, we can work together. Well, it was a tough adventure, but it paid off -- our school is vampire-free! Man, who would've suspected coach feratu? You did great, guys. Couldn't have done it without ya. You know, we -- w-we should be proud of ourselves. We killed a vampire and a gym teacher. Ha ha ha. Talk about two-for-one, right?! So, how, exactly, is your old body living in there, grandpa Rick? Oh, you know, hyperbaric quantum fluid, [burp] That kind of thing. It preserves living tissue. Not that there was much to preserve. Look at that mummy! Ha! Ha ha! And I guess it's time for me to get back inside the old-timer. Oh, my God. Toby Matthews is asking if my parents are still out of town and if we can have a party! All right, way to go, Summer! What did I tell you? Ohh! He's asking if tiny Rick will be here. Well, you know what, Summer? Tell him tiny Rick will be here! And tell him to bring some brews! For real? Y-y-y-you would stay as tiny Rick, just so we can have a party? Hell, yeah! What's one more night? And who can have fun with this old b*st*rd hanging around, huh? [Laughter] Wubby lubby doob doob! Whoo! Tiny Rick! [Growl] Moving on. Now, we have Beth and Jerry Smith from the planet e-arth. My heart is pounding. This is gonna be great. The e-arth relationships are simpler. It's a primitive planet, so their dysfunctions are oh -- w-wait, what? What's going on? Where are the Smith mythologues? [Suspenseful music plays] Jerry: Oh, my God. [Shriek] [Gasp] Aah! Aah! Oh, my God. Secure the cell! Aaaah! [Slice] Uh, hey! You know what's fun? Our gift shop. Why don't we proceed in an orderly -- [growl] [ Whimpering ] Oh, dear God, no. They're codependent! Run! [Roaring] Oh! [Crickets chirp] [Chatting] [Rock music plays] [ Laughter ] Oh, yeah, yeah, you really know how to sport that color blue. Really? You're looking real good. Oh, my God. Hey, Morty. Oh, hey -- hey, Jessica. So, is tiny Rick your brother or cousin, or...? No, my grandpa just transferred his consciousness into a clone of himself so he could be in our high school. Cool. Hey, tiny Rick's playing guitar. All right, everybody. This next one's coming straight from the heart.

Yeah, I know! What kind of operation are you running? Us?! What the hell kind of relationship do you have?! Oh, right, blame this on us. Okay, uh, I can and I am! Your demonized mythologizations of each other are cooperating. Isn't that good? No. No! It's bad! You have the single worst marriage I've ever witnessed. It shouldn't exist! You should never, ever, ever, have gotten together and I do not understand how, or why, you would ever stay together. Aaah! Well, this is just bad couples' therapy. Totally. [Panting] [Suspenseful music plays] Wait for us! There's only room for one more. I'm a therapist. I'll talk to them. They're not therapists. Go, go, go! There's gotta be a way to contact my dad. Let's find a control room or something. [Suspenseful music plays] [Creak] Beth! You'll want to see this. What is it? It's a small, hinged panel with a tiny amount of space behind it. If you can find one, too, we should be safe for hours, maybe days! You stay put, Jerry. I'll send help, if I make it. You don't want to find your own little hatch? Jerry, I believe that, if you hide by yourself, you might survive and I believe I, by myself, have a shot of getting out of here, but the two of us, together? I don't know. Look, maybe the shrink was right. Good luck. [Roar] All right, now, you listen to me. Oh! Or don't. Hey! Don't! Please! [Hissing] [Whining] Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God! Now, I know I've said, in the past, that math is important -- and it is! -- but I also think that, one day, you'll all look back on being in high school with tiny Rick and Morty, who I hear had a great party last night. So, class dismissed. You've got the day off! All right! Good work, Mr. Goldenfold! Yeah, get outside. Read a book. Put on some sunscreen, Danielle! Hey, what's up, Summer? Ooh, nice top. Thanks. Tiny Rick, you think you might be getting back into your old body tonight? No can do. Tonight's the big dance and Morty's bringing Jessica. He needs his tiny wing man. Both: Tiny Rick! [Laughs] Okay, but if not tonight, when? I don't know. When I feel like it? Damn, girl! You need to chill out! This whole thing was your idea, in the first place, and, now, you're trying to rush it along. Yeah, and you know what? I like high school. I like hanging out. Tiny Rick! But what if the you that likes it isn't you? [Laughter] Oh! Both: Oh, Summer! It's just Rick in a younger body. What's the -- what's -- what's -- what's -- what's the -- what's the problem? Look at his art, Morty. I've got an emo streak. It's part of what makes me so rad. Why does it say "help me Morty and Summer!"? Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art. Why was Knight Rider called Knight Rider? The car's name was kitt. Nobody rode Michael Knight. You're overthinking it, Summer. I'm tiny Rick! Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do -- it shoved the bad thoughts into the back and put a wall around them. But those bad thoughts are the real Rick. The fact that you're old, the fact that we're all going to die, one day, the fact that the universe is so big, nothing in it matters, those facts are who you are. So you're trapped in there and you can only come out in the form of tiny Rick's teen angst! Well, Summer, I hear Toby Matthews isn't into psycho chicks. Can't think of anyone that is. I'll see you mother[Bleep] at the dance! Tiny Rick! Morty, you have to help me! Summer, he's happy! I'm happy! I-I-is that why you're doing this, you don't want me and Rick to be happy? No. Well, then get your sh1t together! Get it all together and put it in a backpack. All your sh1t, so it's together. And if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere, you know? Take it to the sh1t store and sell it o-or put it in a sh1t museum. I don't care what you do! You just gotta get it together. Get your sh1t together. [Slug wailing] [Gasping] Get back! [Fart] Wait, for real? [Whimpers] You're how Beth sees me? Oh, my God. Turn around! I said turn around! How can Beth have these thoughts about me?! That judgmental monster bitch! I'm not taking this. I want to know where my wife is. You are going to help me. No! Nobody's doing that! [Growling] Stay. What do you want? Jerrys. You want Jerry? I don't even want Jerry. I want Jerrys. Waahee! An army. [Laughs] An army of Jerrys. The value of his subservience is wasted on you. I will use it to dominate the universe. Ah ha ha. Boy, Jerry must think I'm pretty stupid, for you to be this stupid. Wouldn't it make more sense to put my dumbass husband in this chair, so you can make an army of youbadass self? [Laughs] There could never be more than one of me. I'm the strongest, smartest being alive because Jerry thinks you're that much stronger and smarter than you are! Okay, ouch. ♪ Oh, hey h-hey-y! Morty, Jessica, what's up? Check out the new dance I made up. It's called "ooh let me out!" ♪ Let me out ♪ ♪ let me out ♪ ♪ this is not a dance ♪ ♪ I'm beggin' for help ♪ ♪ I'm screamin' for help ♪ ♪ please come let me out ♪ ♪ let me out ♪ ♪ let me out ♪ ♪ this is not a dance ♪ ♪ I'm beggin' for help ♪ ♪ I'm screamin' for help ♪ ♪ please come let me out ♪ ♪ I'm dyin' in a vat ♪ ♪ in the gara-a-ge ♪ [cheering] Awesome! Okay, that last part was really weird. Maybe Summer's on to something here. I don't know. It was fun. You want to slow dance? Tiny Rick, hey, great dancing as usual. Moment of your time? Tiny Rick, this conversation is gonna break my heart wide open. You're a great student and the fact that you're an 80-year-old man in a clone body, it never bothered me. But this here is another matter. You recognize this? We got a tip it was in your locker. Yeah, now, because the gym coach was a vampire, the school board is embarrassed and won't take it public, however, they can't have students killin' teachers. I gotta expel you for this one, tr. I'm sorry. I just got expelled, Summer! Oh! So I guess there's no need to stay young. My top! Screw your top! You ratted on me?! I'm tiny Rick! Fine! Yes! Because I love you and I'm trying to save your life! High school is my life! Summer Smith is a [Bleep] psycho nerd and she just got me kicked out of school! All: [Gasp] [Thud] Boo! Summer, I thought you were cool! I'm sorry, okay? How can you be such a bitch? Oh, my God, Morty. Your sister crossed tiny Rick? Talk about self-destructive. Yeah. Jerry: Hey, Jerry-lover! How about a taste of the real thing? [Cocks gun] [Roar] Jerry! Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah ah ah ah ah aah aah. Not on my watch. That's it! Beth, it's me, your husband! I'm here to save you. Or my name isn't Jerry Smith! Aha! Yes! Jerry Smith! Yeah, here. Aha! Okay, fair enough. [Ominous music plays] [Door creaks open] Say goodnight, old man. [Gasp] What the hell are you doing?! Put it down! Summer, you bitch! Don't talk to her that way! She's your granddaughter! I don't need a granddaughter! I'm tiny ri-I-ck! She's my sister! And if tiny Rick is gonna be an asshole to my sister, then, you know, y-y-you may as well be old again. You think you're tough, huh, Morty? What are you gonna do? I'm tiny Rick. I'm the coolest kid in your school. How are you gonna just make me do whatever you say, huh? I'm gonna do what real Rick would do if he was here -- I'm gonna kick your ass! Ohhhh!

But listen -- I forgive you both because you know what? I learned, today, something important -- the teenage mind is its own worst enemy. Oh, I also learned this...

Then you would give your pen1s so that shrimply pibbles might live? Stop asking! Yes, I will! That's right, assholes. Take my pen1s. Take it all! And tell shrimply pibbles that when the galaxy came calling, Jerry Smith from earth didn't flinch! [ Laughs ] Hey, w-what's wrong, Morty? Oh, you're worried about your dad, huh? Huh? Oh, no, no, no. I'm just... I'm just looking at that lady over there getting coffee. What's up with her face? Is she human, or is she like worf? You know, worf from "Star Trek," how he has all that sh1t all over his face, but he's just a human in a costume, you know? Morty, uh, let's see what else is on, huh? Okay. And now we're back to "how did I get here?" The only show that makes you ask yourself, "how did I get here?" [ Chuckles ] Here's our first person. Oh. Oh, my God. How did I get here? Hello?! How did I get here?! Somebody, help me, please! Host: [ Laughs ] All right! Holy crap! Look, it's that lady with the sh1t on her face like worf from "Star Trek" that was getting coffee! How did she get there?! Oh, my God, Morty, how did she get there? How did she get there? [ Laughs ] Is that something we should be concerned about? Just stay away from the coffee machine. Man: Calling all jan Michael Vincents. Calling all jan Michael Vincents. Announcer: In a world where there's eight jan Michael Vincents... Man: We need one jan Michael Vincent to quadrant "c." We need two jan Michael Vincents to quadrant "e." and 16 quadrants, there's only enough time for a jan Michael Vincent to make it to a quadrant. He can't be at two quadrants at once. Hey, Rick, who... who is jan Michael Vincent? Oh, man. I'm trying to remember, Morty. Jan Michael Vincents are used up. I need a goddamn jan Michael Vincent. Is it important that we know who jan Michael Vincent was in order to get this? Nope. I-I refuse to send the legislation that allows more than eight jan Michael Vincents to a precinct. This jan-uary, it's time to Michael down your Vincents. "Jan quadrant Vincent 16." Whoa! Whoa! That's jan Michaels. Excuse me, nurse, can you take my temperature because I think I have jan quadrant Vincent fever over here. All right, Morty! You've done it. So, we'll be detaching your sexual organ at the base by making incisions here, here, and here. Got it. Leaving a partial length of severed urethra to be threaded through... [ Laughs ] Oh, you know what, I got to... I got to laugh at myself here. I'm having a little laugh at myself because I just realized I haven't run this whole decision past my wife. Oh. Do you think she'll be okay with this? Oh, absolutely. Beth's automatically on board always with every decision I make. Hey, I'm stealy. Follow me on my adventure through this office. ♪ All right, here we go. We're gonna just steal a couple of things. Excuse me. Can I help you? Starting with common office objects. Hey, hey, hey!

[ Muffled grunting ] ♪ All right, okay, now we're in the quiet safe room where none of the people whose stuff I stole can get to us. Now, let's look at all the stuff we got. We got a bag of bobbish. That's eight brapples. We got a plumbus. That's 61/2 brapples. We got, uh, a... crushed red party cups. 151/2 brapples. [ Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! ] Welcome back to "funny songs." It's all improvised.

I wanted to let you all know that Jerry is doing just fine. Yay! Called it! Yes! Whoo-hoo! That's good news! But, uh, Mrs. Smith, could you come with me? Hi, honey, so, here's the thing... these guys... they want to completely remove my pen1s and use it as an alien's heart. And we just need you to sign off on it. What?! Uh-oh. Maybe we got a problem here after all, guys. Yikes. His pen1s will be replaced with a sophisticated prosthetic. Now, there's a wide range of options to choose from. They're all in this catalogue. I don't care about prosthetics. This is insane. What do you people think you're doing? I understand your feelings, Mrs. Smith. Oh, I don't think you do. I bring my husband in for emergency treatment. He's gone an hour. And now you want his pen1s, and you hand me some... Catalog. It's... it's... it's... it's... I mean... Sheesh. Well, there you go. Sorry. I know it's hard to understand, but on earth, love comes first. There are those that believe, Mr. Smith, that shrimply pibbles represents love between all life. His fate will determine the fate of hundreds of billions of sentient life-forms. Whoa! Whoa. So, billions of life-forms? Hundreds of billions. I mean, Jerry, y-you didn't explain the full gravity of the situation. Uh, well, Beth, I don't think your decision should be based on politics. Who could argue with a wife's decision to keep her lover intact? Well, I don't think that's fair at all, Jerry. At all. In fact, the whole paradigm has sexist overtones. Beth, can we talk about this privately. You know, I think the bottom line is, Jerry, if you want to keep your pen1s, you should say, out loud, "I prefer to keep my pen1s." But, Beth, what kind of man would say something like that if the universe needed his pen1s?! Well, Jerry, what kind of wife would I be if I did anything to stand in your way? Hey, listen, is your mouth tiny and small? Then why don't you come to lil' bits... Man: Lil' bits! where the food is tiny. It looks like regular food, but really tiny.

Little, tiny fried eggs. Oh, sh1t. We got tiny people. Lil' bits! You hungry? Come on down. Lil' bits. Eat some [Bleep] sh1t, you [Bleep] stupid bitch. [ Chuckles ] Just kidding. You've got some time to kill before the procedure, so I assume you'd like to, uh, use your pen1s one last time. Here's my computer. It's got the alien Internet on it. Here's some p0rn. And there's an alien towel. I actually got that on another planet. So it is an alien towel to me. Good luck. Thanks. [ Door closes ] [ Sighs ] What is this? Hmm. Hey, wait a minute.

Hey, everybody. It's me, Michael Thompson. Today the pope didn't get killed. He's perfectly fine. And he's on vacation in Aruba. In other opposite news, information...

Hey, flip back to the news. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You could tell our parents started with naming with him. It's like, "oh, Michael." They had that one planned before they even got pregnant, I bet. I don't want to be that girl, but maybe there would be less conflict if they didn't shoot their shows at the same time. Oh, summer, you have no idea how much money that must save production. And then they found out I was attached, along for the ride, and they said, "ah, sh1t." Well, just [Bleep] it, call him pichael." [Bleep] You, pichael.

Which would you prefer between the xp-20 and the xp-20 xs? I prefer my own pen1s, and so should you! The brave earth man whose sacrifice is going to allow shrimply pibbles to live... Mr. Jerry Smith. [ Cheers and applause ] Hello, everyone! Let's hear it again for shrimply pibbles, huh? He's a good guy, isn't he? I've only just been learning about his accomplishments, from his march on flirk blirk square to his ongoing battle with heroin dependency. He's the best. [ Cheers and applause ] Um, yeah. Well, I-it occurs to me that his heroin addiction may not have been a matter of public record. You realize heroin makes up 10% of the atmosphere on shrimply pibbles' home planet. His planet was destroyed by clorgon death squads. He can't live outside of it without breathing heroin. Right. I know that. I just think... This guy's trying to get out of giving away his pen1s! [ Crowd shouting ] Narrator: Today on "how they do it"... Plumbuses. Everyone has a plumbus in their home. First, they take the dinglebop, and they smooth it out with a bunch of schleem. The schleem is then repurposed for later batches. They take the dinglebop, and they push it through the grumbo, where the fleeb is rubbed against it. It's important that the fleeb is rubbed because the fleeb has all of the fleeb juice. Then a schlami shows up, and he rubs it and spits on it. They cut the fleeb. There's several hizards in the way. The blamfs rub against the chumbles. And the ploobis and grumbo are shaved away. That leaves you with a regular, old plumbus. I always wondered how, uh, plumbuses got made. Hey, welcome back to "personal space." I'm your host Phillip Jacobs, and let me tell you, I care about my personal space. Whoa, whoa. Hey. Who's around me right now? Who's around me?

[ Speaking alien language ] [ Whistle blows ] If you could all just stop screaming and chanting and making whatever that gesture means... excuse me. Come on. Please, everyone, I have news about shrimply pibbles. Word of Jerry Smith trying to weasel out of his pen1s donation has spread across the galaxy. Beings everywhere have come together to offer what little they have to help save shrimply's life. Enough to pay for a brand-new, state-of-the-art synthetic heart that will be even better than Mr. Smith's pathetic pen1s. Wait! That was an option the whole time?! You guys suck! Yeah. We suck. Are you still here? Okay, Jerry. Let's head home. I can't leave now. Everyone hates me. Unfortunately, there's no surgical procedure that can fix that. Or is there? [ Monitor beeping ] Scalpel. Scalpel. Nano-doctor. Nano-doctor. Nano-scalpel. Nano-scalpel. Okay. We're ready. Not so fast! Mr. Smith? What are you doing? Are you insane?! I'm a good person, and I demand that you cut off my pen1s and put it in that man's chest. That's not how it works! Well, you're gonna make it work. [ Knocking ] I'm octopus man! [ Laughs ] I'm octopus man! [ Laughs ] I'm a marine biologist who was bitten by an octopus. [ Laughs ] And now I'm... I help people. I save people. I'm a troublesome octopus person. Uh-oh. I got to save some trouble 'cause here comes a trouble mite. Summer: Gross! Does all interdimensional TV have to rely on juvenile violence? Well, summer, maybe people that create things aren't concerned with your delicate sensibilities, you know? Maybe the species that communicate with each other through the filter of your comfort are less evolved than the ones that just communicate! Maybe your problems are your own to deal with, and maybe the public giving a sh1t about your feelings is a one-way ticket to extinction! Geez, Morty. I take it Cathrine hefflefinger hasn't texted you back yet. I don't want to talk about it. Okay, guys, let's go home. Where's dad? Breaking news. Shrimply pibbles is being held hostage by the human known as Jerry Smith. Remove my pen1s! [ Gasps ] Holy crap! It's cool. It's fine. It's got to be from an alternate reality, right? Are you sure? I don't know. Do it! Do it! Remove my pen1s! Sir, put the gun down and step away from Mr. pibbles! Jerry! Dad, what are you doing?! I'm a good person. I'm a good person. Where did he get a gun?

No, you were shot like 50 times. 57. Thankfully, you're in a super-sophisticated alien hospital, so it was basically like getting a splinter removed. All... all I wanted was for everyone to like me. Jerry, remember that time you left a comment underneath that YouTube video and someone replied and called you a dumb-ass, so you replied and told them, "it takes one to know one," and you stayed up all night hitting "refresh" on your browser waiting for them to reply and then you fell asleep crying? I remember it differently. This is like that. You can't make people like you. You just have to wait for hating you to bore them. You know, you're right. I shouldn't be motivated by other people's opinions of me. All right, guys, let's go home. If it's all the same to you, Rick, I'd like to go to the zoo... With my family. What?! What are you talking about?! Why would we do that?! It's a stupid idea! What's the matter with you!? Don't be a piece of sh1t, Jerry! Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We'll go home.

Outside? Outside? Are you kidding me?! Come on! Oh, my God. What's wrong? Your idiot dog! Oh, he he didn't mean it, dad. Did you, snuffles? You're a good boy. Don't praise him now, Morty! He just peed on the carpet! Bad dog! Bad! Morty, come on. I need your help tonight. Hey, wait, hold on a second, Rick. You wouldn't by any chance have some sort of crazy science thing you could whip up that might help make this dog a little smarter, would you? I thought the whole point of having a dog was to feel superior, Jerry. If I were you, I wouldn't pull that thread. Come on, Morty. Listen, Rick, if you're gonna stay here rent-free and use my son for your stupid science, the least you could do is put a little bit of it to use for the family. You make that dog smart or... Morty's grounded! Ha-ha! Aw, man! Boy, you really got me up against a wall this time, Jerry. All right, ruffles... What's his name? Snuffles. Snuffles, shake. Roll over. Go to the bathroom. Holy crap! No way. Yeah, you're at the top of your game now, Jerry. Have fun. Come on, Morty. That was fantastic, Rick! Yeah, Morty, if you like that, boy, you're you're really going to flip your lid over this one. W-w-w-what is it? It's a device, Morty, that when you put it in your ear, you can enter people's dreams, Morty. It's just like that movie that you keep crowing about. You talking about "Inception"? That's right, Morty. This is gonna be a lot like that, except, you know, it's gonna maybe make sense. "Inception" made sense. You don't have to try to impress me, Morty. Listen, tonight we're gonna go into the home of your math teacher, Mr. Goldenfold, and we're gonna incept the idea in his brain to give you A's in math, Morty. That way you can, you know, y-you're gonna help me with my science, Morty, all the time. Geez, Rick, in the time it took you to make this thing, couldn't you have just, you know, helped me with my homework? Are you listening to me, Morty? Homework is stupid. The whole point is to get less of it. Come on, let's just get over there and deal with this thing. W-we're gonna incept your teacher. You're frustrating me. You don't know me! Nice, Mrs. Pancakes real nice. Next week on "The days and nights of Mrs. Pancakes"... You don't know me! Then let me get to know yo, damn it! Uh-oh! Spoilers! I'm a full season behind. Wow, Rick, I can't believe we're sitting around, standing around in Mr. Goldenfold's house. It's really weird. It's about to get a whole lot weirder, Morty. Wheat thins. Wheat thins. I'll take two. Oh, I think you've had enough, sir. You don't know me. All right, Morty, time to make our move. Make it bounce. No, you didn't. Oh, jiggle it now. You better stop with that. Allahu akbar! We're gonna take control of this plane! We're gonna 9/11 it unless Morty Smith gets better grades in math! Hey! I said nobody move, buddy! The name's not buddy. It's Goldenfold. Nice to wheat you! Take cover, Morty! Ooh! Goldenfold's got more control here than I anticipated. I mean, the guy teaches high-school math. I didn't take him for an active dreamer. We got to take him out so he wakes up, Morty. But we can't get killed. If you get killed in someone else's dream, you die for real, Morty. What?! Are you kidding me?! Ohhhhhh! Don't be a baby! You avoid getting shot in real life all the time, Morty. Just do the same thing here, and we'll be fine! Now bring me my slippers. Now, be my footstool, snuffles. This is what I'm talking about. This is a dog. Oh, yeah. This should play out just fine. You said the same thing, equally sarcastically, at our wedding and guess what. Oh, my God. He's trying to tell us something. That is so awesome. Aw, he's saying "I love lasagna". He's saying "I love Obama". So cute! I'm posting this online, like, right now. I should call Bob Saget. Is that still a thing? Hmm? Goldenfold, we're coming out! We just want to talk! Why would I negotiate with you? Because we're both rational adults that don't want anything bad to happen. And because I have a human shield. Mrs. Pancakes! Oh, no, Morty. His subconscious is panicking. Run! Relax, Morty. Look! Mrs. Pancakes has a parachute. Come on! Hey, you don't know me! Oh, no, Rick, look! Goldenfold landed the plane, and he's created a mechanical arm to pluck Mrs. Pancakes out of the air while he lets us fall into a giant vat of lava! Pretty concise, Morty. Looks like we've merely prolonged the inevitable. That's it, Morty! Prolonging the inevitable! Listen, if we go into Mrs. Pancakes' dream, everything will go 100 times slower, Morty. That'll buy us some time to figure this out! You don't know m- All right, let's go. Oh, man, Rick, this is pretty weird. Don't judge, Morty. Okay. All right, well... Look, Mrs. Pancakes is right over there. I'll just go ask her to tell goldenfold not to kill us when she wakes up. Whoa, whoa, Morty, the trick to incepting is making people think they came up with the idea. Listen to me. If we're gonna incept Mrs. Pancakes, we have to blend. I'll talk to you after lunch. Ooh, hey! Ooh, oh! Oh, man. Come and join us. I'm sorry. No, no. Ooh, come here! No, thanks! Ooh, wow! Come over here, baby! No, I'm okay. Whoa! Summer?! Hey, there, stranger. What do you think of these things? Ohh! Oh! Gross! Gross! Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's the matter with you, Morty? Calm down! You're kind of killing the vibe in here. It's Summer! Aw, geez. Looks like goldenfold has some predilections so shameful he buries them in the dreams of the people in his dreams, including a pervy attraction to your underage sister. Can you blame him? Come on, old man, little boy. Let's make an inter-generational sandwich. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Put some clothes on, for Pete's sake! This is disgusting! I'm gonna puke! I can't take it, Rick! Sexual hang-ups in the pleasure chamber are punishable by death! Off with their heads! Time to go another dream deep, Morty! What the hell? Why would Mr. goldenfold's dream version of Mrs. Pancakes' dream version of a centaur be dreaming about a scary place like this, Rick? Geez, I don't know, Morty. Wha-what do you want from me? Welcome to your nightmare, bitch! Oh, here we go! Holy crap! Looks like some sort of legally safe knock-off of an '80s horror character with miniature swords for fingers instead of knives. I'm scary Terry. You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Whoa! Hey, buddy. What you got going on there? Snuffles fix. Make better. Humans understand snuffles now? That... is... awesome! Snuffles want to be understood. Snuffles need to be understood. Okay, yeah. I get what Beth was talking about. Fun's over. Whoa, dad, you can't, like, endow a creature with sentience and then rip it away. Why not? I don't know. It's Indian giving. A sophisticated predator, nature's perfect killing machine, the vicious wolf stalks its prey with purpose and skill. It was only with years of selective breeding and genetic altering that this noble beast was transformed into man's subservient little buddy. Aw! Oh, my God! He recognizes the other dogs on TV. "A," "b" his name is scary Terry "C," "d" he's very scary Holy crap! We have to escape into someone else's dreams, Morty! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! "E," "f" he'll design your death The little girl! Huh? "J," "k," he'll really ruin your day Are you kidding me? This again? Oh, man, it looks like we've hit dream bedrock here, Morty. Oh, geez, Rick. W-w-whoa, this isn't good. Nothing but fear from here on out, bitch! Ohhhh! Holy crap, Morty. He can travel through dreams. He can travel through dreams! We're so screwed! Where are my testicles, Summer? Where are my testicles, Summer? They were removed. Where have they gone? Oh, wow. That's an intense line of questioning, snuffles. Do not call me that! "Snuffles" was my slave name. You shall now call me snowball, because my fur is pretty and white. Okay, snowball, just calm down, okay? You're scaring me. Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a human was born with stumpy legs, would they breed it with another deformed human and put their children on display like the dachshund? Uhhh... Hey. Oh, wow. Okay, is is is everything okay in here? Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again? No! No, we were... uh, just seeing if Summer wanted to... uh... Go on, um, one of our famous midnight family walks! Yeah. Totally. Let's go. You will walk when it is time to walk. What are we here for again? Incepting? We're trying to incept me to get an "A" in math? Oh, yeah. Buckle up, bitch! Man, he sure says "bitch" a lot! You can run, but you can't hide, bitch! Hold on, Morty. Y-you know what? He keeps saying we can run but we can hide. I say we try hiding. But that's the opposite of what- Yeah, well, since when are we taking this guy's advice on anything? Hey, you know what? You got a really good point there, Rick. Like, if the truth was that we could hide, it's not like he'd be sharing that information with us, you know? I-I-I think it's a good idea, Rick. Worst-case scenario we're back to running. Wow, you know what? I mean, it looks like we could have just hid this whole time. Boy, Rick, that was some good thinking. Thanks, Morty. Yeah, it's nice to be on the same page every once in a while. You can run... But you can't hide! Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look at that. He's getting sleepy. Just a little bit longer before he calls it a day. That's when we make our move. Snuffles, we didn't mean you any harm! This is a huge misunderstanding. Dad, he wants to be called snowball. Well, I'm not calling him that. That's ridiculous. You're being very aggressive, Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. scraps will solve that problem with a bit of surgery. You think you can control me with a haircut? Hi, honey. You're home early. How was your day? I don't want to talk about it! Oh, of course. You never want to talk about it. Get off my back, bitch! Out there. Not in here. Yeah, I know, I know. I shouldn't take my anger out on you or scary Brandon. I love you, Melissa. I love you, too, Terry. Morty, this is perfect. After a little scary coitus, they should be fast asleep and then we'll incept him. Looks like scary Terry's having a nightmare. Oh, boy, Rick. I can only imagine what horrible things must, you know... scare scary Terry. Oh, no! I'm late to class, bitch! Oh, no! I'm not wearing any pants! Ah, well, Mr. Terry, why don't you tell the whole class the proper wordplay to use when one is chasing one's victim through a pumpkin patch? Oh... um... "Bitch." Oh, come on, Terry, you can't think of a pun involving pumpkins, bitch? Hey, leave him alone! Yeah, this is a bunch of bullcrap. Who cares what stupid pun you make when you kill someone? Why don't you let the poor guy say whatever he wants? Well, I never! I-I see no reason to stand here and take this. You're putting too much pressure on yourself, scary Terry. You know, I mean, y-you're perfectly scary enough as it is. Hey, yo, scary T., don't even trip about your pants... dawg. Here's a pair on us, fool. Aww, bitch. I don't know what to say. You don't need to say anything. We got you, dawg. You're our boy, dawg. Don't even trip. Oh, hey, it's you guys! I haven't seen him this relaxed in years. If you guys ever need anything, just say the word. As a matter of fact, Terry, there is something you could help us with. "Q," "r," you won't get very far I always hated that song! These halves don't belong together, bitch! s*x is sacred! This is because you don't give Morty Smith good grades, bitch! Holy crap! God damn! I know one thing for sure... I'm giving Morty an "A" in math, and that's my idea. That is an original thought. What the hell? Out of the frying pan dot, dot, dot, huh, Morty? Oh, man, what's going on? Well, it's possible that your dog became self-aware and made modifications on the cognition amplifier, then turned on Jerry, Beth, and Summer after learning about humanity's cruel subjugation of his species, but your guess is as good as mine, Morty. I can't believe how mean snuffles got just because he's smart. This is why I choose to get C's. Psst, Beth, Jerry, Summer. Dad! Rick! Oh, thank God, Morty. Oh, you're welcome. All right, let's get out of here. If we hurry we can set up camp in a sewer tunnel or something before the dogs completely take over. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We're not going anywhere. This is my house. I'm not abandoning it. It's all over, Jerry. The dogs are on a path to total world domination. But, hey, at least they know not to piss on your carpet, right? Wait a minute. I have an idea. Gentlemen, a moment of your time. See that? I'm peeing all over your special guns. That means I own them. Bad person. Bad. Ooh, great plan, Jerry. Bring the boy to me. You were always kind to me, Morty. That's why I will leave you with your testicles. From now on, you will be my best friend and live by my side. Th-thanks, snuffles. Begin phase two. Fighting continues as the dog army captures the eastern seaboard. It appears clear at this time... that the era of human superiority has come to a bitter end. Please! Please don't kill me! What's she saying, bill? I think she's saying, "I love lasagna." Mmm. Thank you, Fido. Rick! I thought you were dead! No, no, no, I was just playing dead. Good news, though, Morty. This whole thing's gonna be over really soon. What? It's a dream, Morty. We're in your dog's dream. The night the dogs captured us, after you cried and crapped your pants, we all went to sleep. Then I used my dream inceptors to put the two of us inside snuffles' dream. But I-it's been like a whole year! It's been six hours. Dreams move one one-hundredth the speed of reality, and dog time is one-seventh human time. So, you know, every day here is like a minute. It's like "Inception," Morty, so if it's confusing and stupid, then so is everyone's favorite movie. Aw, man. I really liked this life. Well, at least I didn't really crap my pants. No, no, that happened before you went to sleep, Morty. You're sleeping in your crap right now. Out of all the things that happened to you, that was the only real thing that, you know, is that you crapped your pants. I mean, it's a mess out there. I got some on my hands, Morty, and then I got it on the dream inceptor, and a piece fell in my mouth. Aw, man, geez! Seriously? Look, d-d-d-don't worry about it, Morty. Here, here take these, Morty. Take these. Are these pills supposed to wake me up, or something? Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. What?! It's necessary for the plan, Morty. Don't even trip, dawg. It's pretty bad, emperor snowball. We're gonna need to do another operation. Anything. Anything for my precious Morty. Sir, as your accountant, I must advise you that these medical expenses are putting you in serious financial jeopardy. You could lose your kingdom. To hell with my kingdom, bean counter. I would trade it all for my human's health and happiness. Do you think they would have done this for us? We are not them! We are not... them. Assemble the troops. I've made a decision. Taking over the human's world will lead to nothing but more heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead, we will go to a new world and colonize it with a society of intelligent dogs, one that will not make the same mistakes as humanity and one where pet insurance will be mandatory. I'm gonna miss you, snowball. You can call me snuffles, Morty, and I'm going to miss you, too, very much. Jerry? I'm sorry. It's just like the end of "Old Yeller." Oh, Jerry. You mean because it had dogs in it. Wow! A whole world populated by intelligent dogs. I wonder what it'll be like, Rick. I think it will be great, Morty. You know... it could be developed in-into a very satisfying project for people of all ages. I mean, I'd watch it, Morty, for at least 11 minutes a pop. You know, may-maybe they'll do it board-driven. You know, that's a real comforting idea, Rick. What do you know, Morty? What do you know? Hi, guys. I'm your new teacher for scary class. My name is scary Mr. Johnson. Uh, actually, you know what? That's my dad's name, so why don't you just call me scary Glenn, yeah? So, anyway, I understand your previous teacher was having you work on fundamentals of fear. Which is what is that? You know? So, uh, here here's what I say... you can't learn anything until you learn... how to chill. Oooh! This is how you dream, bitch.I got to tell you, Rick. It's pretty great to be in this spaceship, just the two of us, you know? Just cruising around, Rick and Morty style. I agree, Morty. [ Belches ] It's nice to get back to the basics after a pretty intense, mixed-bag of a year. Ohh! Relax. That's what windshields are for. I didn't know that there were bugs out in space. Well, w-what did you think, Morty? Life just developed on earth by itself? Here, let me take care of this. Geez, Rick, that's disgusting. I don't want to look at that. Yeah, guess I'm out of fluid. L-let me find a place to stop. Hey, muchacho, does your planet have wiper fluid yet, or are you gonna freak out and start worshipping us? The general store ought to have what you need. Thanks. Of course, you'll be wanting to be gone from here by sundown. Yeah, sure thing. Wait a minute. What? Why? Sundown is when the festival begins. The festival? Ooh, well, for millennia, our society has been free of crime and war, living in perfect peace. Oh, I know what this is! You've been able to sustain world peace because you have one night a year where you all run around robbing and murdering each other without consequence. That's right. What?! It's like "the purge," Morty. That movie "the purge"? Oh, have you been here before? No, no, but I've been to a few planets with the same gimmick. You know, sometimes it's called the cleansing or the red time. There was this one world that called it just murder night. I-it's a purge planet. They're peaceful, and then, you know, they just purge. T-that's horrible! Yeah. You want to check it out? ♪ [ Electricity crackling ] So, what do you do during the festival? You lock yourself in, or you go out and do some stuff? Oh, I do some pretty bad stuff. Oh, I bet you do, old timer. [ Laughs ] Gee... Rick, come on. The sun is setting. W-we got to get out of here. All right, well, w-what do I owe you for the wiper fluid? It's on the house. Oh, and, uh, why... why don't you have some candy bars, as well? Oh, no way. That's really nice of you. I'm a nice guy... For now. [ Chuckling ] Ohh, I don't doubt it. Rick! Yeah, yeah. Hey, have a good festival, old timer. I intend to. Rick, unlock it! Just a second, Morty. Oh, look at that sunset. Stop screwing around. [ Click ] There we go. Much better. Now we can see. Great. Hey, you know what, Morty? Why don't we christen our squeaky-clean windshield here by watching a little of this purge through it? What?! No! What is your problem?! Morty, grow up. If you don't want to watch, don't watch, but, you know, it's my car. [ Belches ] Also, if you tell your mom about this, I'll purge you. You're the worst. And this planet is the worst. How can you be into this? You know, people are gonna kill each other. So, what, y-y-you trying to sit here and tell me that [belches] I-if... if there's a video online with someone getting decapitated, you don't click on it? No! Why... why would I do that? You do that? I don't, because it would bore me. I see [Bleep] like that for breakfast, Morty. But if you don't do it, I say it's because you're afraid of your own primal instincts. So you stuff them down and... [ Bell chiming ] Oh, oh! Shh. Shh. It's starting. Oh-ho-ho! Here we go. I'm not watching. Yeah, yeah, yeah, your medal's in the mail. I'm gonna get a closer look. Oh, okay, sure. And then someone's gonna throw a rock and hit the car and then we're gonna crash and we're gonna be stuck down there and it's gonna be what we deserve. Yawn. Whoa! [ Indistinct shouting ] Whoa, they are purging the [Bleep] out of each other. [ Muffled screaming ] Oh, my God! Oh [Bleep] That was... okay, yeah. T-that was gross. Wow. Man, I think my eyes were bigger than my stomach on this one, Morty. Ugh. My appetite for purge-spectating got filled pretty quick. Oh, God. [ Grunts ] [ Retching ] [ Woman screaming ] Get away from me! No! No! Help! Somebody help me! Aah! All right, Morty. L-let's get out of here. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. W-we have to go down there. [ Belching ] What? Why? That poor girl. W-we have to save her. Uh, Morty, in space, we have something we call the non-interference policy. We got the wiper fluid. We watched them kill each other. We're leaving. Help me save that girl, or I'm telling mom you brought me here. You little turd. [ Screaming ] Please! Leave me alone! Leave you alone? During a purge? I don't think so, baby. It's okay. We're not gonna hurt you. My name is Morty. This is my grandpa. We're tourists. Not anymore. Aah! Aah! Oh, my God. This is [Bleep] awesome! Morty, this is really cool. Hey, y-you want to help me out here and kill some people? It's fun. We're totally justified because we're saving a little girl. I mean, w-w-we're both free and clear to murder these people. Are you okay? Yes. I have to find somewhere to hide. Well, you can hide with us. Rick? Yeah? Do you think we could take... w-what's your name? Arthrisha. Could we take arthrisha up in the ship and, you know, just wait out the purge? Oh, Morty, how can I refuse after all you've done to blackmail me? Your vehicle... is it from the gods? No. Yes. So, uh, you know, when the purge started, did people get into it right away, or were they like, "wait, what?" This is gonna stop crime how, exactly?" Yeah, it took some time for people to accept it. Yeah, I bet. [ Chuckles ] I bet. Yeah, it's kind of like cellphones, you know? At first, everyone was like, "look at those douchebags purging," and then the next thing you know, they're like, "it's just so convenient." Geez, you working on your tight five for the comedy store, Morty? Whatcha doing? Watching some TV, playing on your phone? Is that a real question? Just making conversation. Are you? What part of that gives me anything to work with? My choice is to say nothing, be sarcastic, or bark "yes" like a trained animal. It's not a conversation. You're holding me verbally hostage. Okay, ass-face. I'll go in the kitchen. Hey, dad. Yeah? Whatcha doing? Going into the kitchen? Okay. Yeah, you like that? Screw you. So, uh, do most people wear masks when they purge? I-I don't want to answer any more purge questions. All right, hey, hey, that's cool. I can roll with that. [ Blowing raspberries ] [ Gasps ] My Nana! Huh? My Nana! We have to save her! You just now remembered your Nana exists. I-I was traumatized. Haven't you been through like 15 purges? I mean, some as a child? Will somebody just help me get her? Fine, whatever. Morty, stay. Oh, God. Oh, crap. Oh, crap! Get out! Get out! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa! Get the [Bleep] out of the flying machine! Oh, my God! O-okay! Okay! Back up, asshole. [ Whimpers ] Back up. Ohh. Back the [Bleep] up! Aah! For what it's worth, I'm sorry, but that's not really worth anything tonight, is it? Y-you can't leave us here. You're killing us! You hear me? Come back. Y-you got to come back. Change your mind. Oh, geez. Morty! Aah! [Bleep] Amish bitch shot me! [ Grunts ] She tried to purge me, Morty. You let your wiener do the walking, and now I'm dead. Rick, she took the car! You [Bleep] kidding me, Morty?! She took my car and the gun. We're like the rest of these assholes now. W-w-we're gonna get purged, Morty. Help me up. Oh, geez, geez! Wait a minute, Rick. Why don't we just use your portal gun? It's in the car, dip-ass. [ Grunts ] Oh, God, it hurts. She got me right in the goddamn liver, Morty. It's the hardest-working liver in the galaxy, Morty, and now it has a hole in it. I hope it was worth it. I was just trying to do right. Yeah, well, that's not really the theme of tonight's party. Heads up. Rapists. Well, don't just stand there, Morty. Purge 'em. Me? No, me. Should I rub my liver hole on them? Pick up a stick or something and kill them. Um, w-we come in peace. [ Screaming ] Oh, my God. [ Grunts ] There's more where that came from! You want to get purged, you bring it! Drop [Belches] drop your sh1t! Drop it all. Morty, go get their sh1t. Hurry up. I only had one of those things I threw. I'm holding a box of tic tacs right now. Want some crackers? No, thank you. Are you ready to be nice to me? In exchange for crackers? What happened to you? Dad, get a job. You're trying to create drama because you're bored. Oh. [ Beeping, whirring ] It's the space phone grandpa gave us. Hello? Hey, Summer, it's grandpa. I need you to do me a favor. I can barely hear you. Who is it? Morty and I are on a planet that's purging. I need you to take down... A plan that's what? We're on a planet that's purging, Summer. Purging. We lost our car and my gun, and we're in a purge. Ooh, is it taddi Mason? Like the movie "the purge"? Yes, I-I need you to take... that movie sucked. Oh, my God. Hold on. It's not taddi Mason? Dad, who the [Bleep] is taddi Mason? My friend. Aah! Are you okay? I'm putting you on speaker. Taddi? Yes, Jerry, it's taddi, a person no one's ever heard of until now, calling you on a space phone. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic. [ Growls ] Aah! [ Growling ] [ Gunshots ] Reload, fast. Summer, w-we need you to take down this number. Quit screwing around. Morty? Are you all right? No! Why are you with taddi Mason? Holy [Bleep] dad! Shut the [Bleep] up! Okay. I guess I'm just this entire family's toilet paper. Are you writing this down? Will you please write this down? Summer: Yes, yes. 7-7-1-9-8... [ Growling ] 3-6-4-2-1-1-2-5. Aah! [ Growling ] You son of a bitch! Morty, I don't want to be the "a little help" guy, but a little help? Aah! Okay, I have a pen. Go. 7-7-1-9-8-3- 6-4-2-1-1-2-5. A spoon, Morty? A spoon?! I'm sorry. There's a pile of silverware next to you, and you throw me the one thing that can never kill anything? All right, okay! Summer, on the shelf above my workbench in the garage, there's a red box with a keypad on it. You're gonna take that box outside, and you're gonna type the number I just gave you into the keypad. Got it? Got it. Is it just part of growing up to hate your dad? I'm ignoring you. Morty, if I can get to the top of that lighthouse, I can send the beacon, and your sister can launch our package. Just remember, if there's people in there and they try to purge us, we got to purge them first. We're not purging anyone, Rick, all right? W-will you stop it? Morty, if we're gonna survive tonight, you're gonna need to harness your repressed rage. I don't have any! Spoken like a person with repressed rage. [ Doorbell rings ] I take no part in the festival. If you desire to kill me, I only ask you do it quickly. No such agenda, chief. We're not too keen on the purge, either, sir. We were just hoping to get on the roof of your lighthouse so we can send a beacon to my sister on earth. It's a different planet. By the way, life on other planets exists. Don't let it distract you. I'll let you use my lighthouse for shelter and beacon-sending on the condition that you listen to my tale. Okay. Deal. All right, I'm gonna go to the roof and set things up. Morty, you listen to his tale. Okay. [ Clears throat ] "Fade in. Exterior. Unnamed city. Day." The hustle and bustle is a symphony of progress. We pan past windows, each of which contain a different story, to find jacey lakims, 28... hot, but doesn't know it. Jacey stops when her high heel gets caught in the grating of a sewer. Suddenly, a man steps into frame and points a gun at her. This is not her day. Fade to black. "Title... 'three weeks earlier.'" [ sighs ] You really don't want to talk to me about this. Dad, grandpa and Morty are in danger. You're unemployed, and you're bored. They're a higher priority. Stop saying I'm unemployed! Okay, 7-7-1-9-8-3-6-4-2-1-1 2... aah! Good lord! Now what? [ Whirring, humming ] Look, I'm your father, and I love you is all I'm saying. I'll leave it at that. Fine, dad! [ Both scream ] Oh, he might have said to take it outside. Rick: Come on, Summer. How hard is it to type some numbers into a box? Target locked. [ Device beeps ] Oh, thank God. Well, I did my job. Summer did her job. Now all Morty has to do is finish listening to that tale. "Blane: Maybe I don't need a new friend." Jacey: Maybe you're the only friend I need. Blane: Need, or want? Jacey: I've never been much for wanting. "Blane: Spoken like someone with needs." Oh, geez. Hmm? Uh, sorry. K-keep going. "Jacey reaches out and touches his face." It's clear he needs what she wants. She's a woman. He's a man. The city burns in the background as he takes her in his arms. Fade out. Title... 'the end'... "Question mark." Wow. Yeah? It's... G-good job. Good job. You liked it? Of course I did. You didn't laugh at the scene in the bar. I...Thought it was funny, but I wanted to hear the rest. Do you have any thoughts? Notes? No. I-I just enjoyed it. That's my note, you know? Please write more. Seems a little insincere. What? No. You don't have to mollycoddle me. I want to improve my writing. Tell me your real thoughts. All right. Well, um, I'm not a huge fan, personally, of the whole "three weeks earlier" teaser thing. I feel like, you know, we should start our stories where they begin not start them where they get interest... get out. Um, what? No, I'm sick of this. You bang on my door, you beg me to help you, I share something personal with you, and you take a giant sh1t on it. Hey, man, we asked if we could put up a beacon... well, you can't. I want you out of here. You're a petty person, and you're insecure, and you're taking it out on me. That's a good script. What the hell?! I don't care. I want you out. What? Take that thing down. Your grandson is a shitty person. Leave now. Morty! Rick, I didn't do anything. I sat through his entire screenplay... you "sat through it"? Yes! Did you want me to weep with joy? It's terrible! Whoa! Morty! We're guests here. I tried to be a good guest! He dragged it out of me! I'm taking down this beacon. No, stop! That's not fair! Just because you hate your own writing doesn't make me a bad person! Aah! You like that? You want me to cut to three weeks earlier when you were alive? Whoa, Morty. You just purged. Beacon arriving. [ Device beeps ] Okay, time to go. Well, terrific. [ Sighs ] Dad, what's going on? What's the deal here? I just wanted to spend some time with my daughter. You're growing up so fast. You used to be my little girl. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. Remember when we used to go to the playground, and I'd push you on the swings? Oh, you could push me higher than all the other kids. You were so small and cute. I thought you were gonna fly right off into the street. [ Chuckling ] I used to pee my pants. I know, and now look at you! You have a job. You're making really good money. You're not paying any rent, so you have plenty of disposable income. Oh, God, dad. Please, don't. I just need a few hundred dollars to get through the month. I have some interviews coming up. Something's gonna come through. I can feel it. I'm going inside. [ Door shuts ] [ Sighs ] I guess this is what rock bottom feels like, Jerry. Ow! It's okay, Morty. It's the purge, you know? Pushing old lighthouse keepers down the stairs is totally cool. It's not cool, Rick. I-I'm not like these people. I can't run around chopping people's heads off one day a year and then sleep well the rest of the time. Well, you better start getting used to it, little bitch, because we got some [Bleep] company. Hey, there he is. Here I am. [ Beacon whirring ] Morty. Time to [Belches] purge. [ Gunfire, screaming ] [ Tony! Toni!

I wouldn't it for the world! Oh, my God. I love your ring. Thanks. It was birdperson's grandmother's. She fought a squirrel for it. Birdperson. Rick, I am pleased you and your family could witness my melding with Tammy. Our pleasure. Yeah, I just hope you got a pre-meld. Rick! What?! It's just a practical way of making sure that when she's done with you, you can get one of your balls back. Jesus, dad. He's just grumpy from the flight. Ohh, I-I was happy on the flight. I'm grumpy from the landing. [ Sighs ] Well, I looked at the guest book. We don't know a damn person here. Hi! Jerry Smith... father of the bride's friend. Advertising is my usual game, but I'm between... Jerry, stop networking. We're in space. "Jerry, get a job! Jerry, don't look for a job at an alien wedding!" I don't get you. This is the closest I've ever gotten to this part of my father's life. I don't want to blow it. Okay, I get it. I'm cramping your style. You say you get it, but I'm scared you'll keep doing it. Look, here's some humans you can practice on. You must be Summer's mom and dad. We're Tammy's parents... pat and Donna guterman. Hi. Beth. This is Jerry. So you're teenage daughter's marrying a birdman. Are you guys down with that? [ Chuckles ] No pun intended. We're quite proud. He's a wonderful person and an incredible bird. Still, what is he, 40? [ Chuckles ] It's just, you know, when he was 30, she was an actual child. When he was her age, she wasn't born. When he was, let's see, like, 18, she was literally in there in your womb. Imagine being pregnant with your daughter and a bird teenager comes into your home and says, "I'll take that. I'll have s*x with that." [ Both chuckle ] Give us one second. Oof! Were you born with your feet in your mouth? I was transported here against my will in a meatball, all right? So take your attitude to the men's section of kmart 'cause you need to cut me some slack... S. I want you to stand in the corner and face the corner and talk to nobody. Maybe... I... Will. You know, you're not being very supportive of birdperson on his big day. Birdperson's big day, Morty, was at blood Ridge on glapflap's third moon against the gromflamites! This? This is a losing battle. Geez, Rick, it's not like he's dying. He's getting married! I mean, what do you think's gonna happen if you open yourself up a little bit? I mean, look around. This is your family and friends all around you, you know? Take the day off. There's nothing to run from, nothing to fight. [ Whistles ] That's his last name. Are you hyphenating it? Squanch this, mo-fo. [ Both laugh ] Good one, Morty. Excuse me, bartender. Can you make me a dumb grandson pep talk? It's one part lame advice about stuff you know nothing about and a lot of vodka. Mm-hmm. I have a lot of vodka. Then I'll take one of those. I don't need the rest. God, whatever, Rick. Oh, it sounds like you and my dad have a long history together. Wish I could say the same. The road your father and I walked together is soaked deeply with the blood of both friends and enemies. Must be nice. Um, I used to have to draw him into family photos with a crayon. The war in which we fought is far from over. We live our lives in hiding. I guess I should be happy for you. I mean, great, you guys got to hang out. I hope you had a blast. The galactic government considers us terrorists. It's unwise of me to share these details, but I've become inebriated. I don't know if you can appreciate what it means to grow up without a father, but... the guest list at this wedding includes 17 of the federation's most wanted. We have committed numerous atrocities in the name of freedom. Annnd during that time, I don't suppose he ever mentioned his daughter. Are those baby quiches? Night crawler pate. I should prepare for the ceremony. Like talking to a brick wall. [ Squawking ] In the name of the squanch, the six rivers, the four squanches, and the nine balls, I unite these two organisms in eternal squanch! Tammy, you may squanch your vows now. Birdperson... [ Inhales sharply ] You are my seed, my worm, my earliness, and my lack of cats. I promise to be yours until your death. Nice! All: Aww! Birdperson. Tammy, I was approaching infertility when I met you, but there is still time. I am yours until my death. All: Aww! [ Burping ] Aww. I now pronounce you squanch and birdperson! [ Cheers and applause and profane kissing ] ♪ Girl, you got it going on ♪ [ children laughing ] [ Monotone ] I am not staring at you. I am a cyborg photographer. Just act natural. This is a candid shot. I don't require a camera so... sorry. Hi. I am not staring at you. [ Screams ] [ Clinking ] Uh, hi, everybody. I'm ri[Burps]ck. You know, when I first met birdperson, he was, uhh... Listen, I'm not the nicest guy in the Universe because I'm the smartest. And being nice is something stupid people do to hedge their bets. Now, I haven't been exactly subtle about how little I trust marriage. I couldn't make it work, and I could turn a black hole into a sun, so at a certain point, you got to ask yourself what are the odds this is legit and not just some big lie we're all telling ourselves because we're afraid to die alone? Because, you know, that's exactly how we all die... alone. Oh, boy. Oh, dad. Jesus. But... but... Here's the thing. Birdperson is my best friend, and if he loves Tammy, well, then I love Tammy, too. [ Cheers and applause ] To friendship, to love, and to my greatest adventure yet... opening myself up to others. Summer: Hear, hear! Cheers! Cheers to that, mother[Bleep] Thank you, Rick. That was beautiful. Gosh, I look around this room, and I think, "uh, Tammy, you're a high-school senior from the planet earth, and you're marrying a 40-year-old birdperson? Like, what?!" [ Laughter ] Yeah, Tammy! But then I think, you know, in a lot of ways, I'm not a high-school senior from the planet earth. In a lot of ways, what I really am is a deep-cover agent for the galactic federation, and you guys are a group of wanted criminals, and this entire building is, in a certain sense, surrounded. [ All murmur ] Oh, sh1t. I...Don't get the metaphor. I'll explain it to you later. Everyone here is under arrest for crimes against the federation. L'Chaim! Tammy, what are you doing? Sit your bird ass down. Tammy? [ Cawing weakly ] Birdperson!! No!! [ Screaming ] Holy... [ beep ] Drop the portal gun. Slide it to the center of the room. [ Beeping ] Somebody confiscate that and don't damage it. They'll want it at... [ whooshing ] [ High-pitched ringing and muffled background ] [ Sighs, roars ] There's no time to squanch! Get your family out of here! I got this. [ Gulps ] [ Roaring ] [ Deep voice ] How about a taste of my squanch?! [ Growling ] Come on, this way! Squanch this! [ Engine turns over ] Good thing I grabbed a space weapon. That's a confetti gun, you [Bleep] idiot! Beth: Dad! Hold on tight! Aaah!! Aaaah!! [ Sirens wailing ] God damn it! God damn it!! What the hell happened back there?! This is on you guys. I told you weddings are stupid. Uh, Rick, is there anything you'd like to tell us about your relationship with this previously unknown galactic government? All the important points seem pretty clear, no? They think they control the galaxy, I disagree. Don't hate the player, hate the game, son. How could you be so dishonest with this family? Oh! Oh, should I have been more open and trusting and loving like, oh, I don't know, my now dead best friend? Or your daughter, who is bffs with an intergalactic narc? Hey, Tammy was cool! And now we know why. Because of you! [Bleep] You, Summer, and [Bleep] the government, and [Bleep] me for letting my guard down, which I will never do again. Geez, Rick! You can't say f... "'f' you" to your granddaughter. I just did, Morty. Here's dessert. [Bleep] You. Look, I think we've all had a tough wedding. Actually, the wedding was beautiful. The reception got out of hand. Anyway, I say we go home, sleep it off, and have a family meeting in the morning. Yeah, about going home, we can't... ever. All: What?! Oh, these guys are looking for us now. Earth will be swarming with them. Us?! Jerry... I want to go home! Look, anyone that wants to go back to earth is free to go back to earth. But here's what's gonna happen. Aliens bureaucrats are gonna arrest you. They're gonna put the intergalactic equivalent of [Burps] jumper cables under your nuts and or labia and hook them up to an alien car battery until you tell them where I am... which I guarantee you, you're not gonna know, which I guarantee they won't believe. So who's homesick? By applause. [ Sobbing ] Ladies? Anybody? What are we going to do? Where are we going to live? Take it easy. This is a blessing in disguise. [Bleep] Earth. You realize our planet's name means dirt, right? We'll find a new world. Computer, how many planets in the milky way are at least 90% similar to earth? [ Beeping ] Woman: 765 known planets. How many of those are outside federal jurisdiction? [ Beeping ] Three. See? Our cup runneth over. Now, who wants to go shopping for a brand-new mother[Bleep] world?! All right! Look at this baby! Would you even know that wasn't earth? Morty: Yes, because there's no Africa. Pssh. White-people problems, Morty. Let's go down and check her out. [ Thud, water splashing ] Oh. I thought it was further away. I uh... I guess this one's a little small. All right, uh, maybe... maybe we should go check out the other two, huh? Okay, this one's bigger. This looks nice. Mom, dad, look! Strawberries on a cob! [ Munching ] Whoa! Hey, check this out! Flowers on a cob! [ Laughs ] Huh. Strawberries and flowers on a cob, huh? That's pretty cool. Are those... Mountains on a cob? [ Birds cawing ] Rick: Oh, my God. Get in the ship, sweetie. What? Get in the god[Bleep] ship!! Everything's on a cob!! The whole planet's on a cob!! Go, go, go!! [ Engine turns over ] [ Burps ] All right, third time's the charm. See what we got here. Seems good. And nothing on the cob. Didn't know that was a necessity, but... No, it's nice. I think this might be it. Wow! Hey, look, you guys. The sun's rising. Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!! Uh, dad, how long are the days on this planet? Uh, computer, how long are the days on this planet? [ Screaming continues ] 42 hours. All right, well, those are the two choices 'cause cob planet is off the table. Now let's take a vote. Man: Well, it's official. The obscure planet known as earth, formerly the hiding place of interstellar terrorist and fugitive Rick Sanchez, has just become the 6,048th planet to join the galactic federation. The plucky little ball of water and dirt, which is where it gets its name, is dominated by seven billion primate-descended natives who love to eat spaghetti and pray to kangaroos. Spaghetti, kangaroos? I've got to check this place out. [ Both laugh ] Well, you can. Contact the ministry of tourism for details. Up next, teenagers are calling it [ growls and squeals] And it's not what you think. What are you... what did you do that for? Dramatic effect. Good morning, family. Oh, do I smell bacon? Yes, we discovered a species of tiny pig off the coast of new Australia about 30 yards east. Or 300 yards west. We'd offer you some, but we hunted it to extinction for breakfast. Well, I thought I'd walk to the South pole and do a little bit of exploring. If you guys need me, just yell or throw something so hard that it goes around the world and hits me. [ Door shuts ] Okay, now that he's gone, can we please talk about our situation? Dad, you can't talk about people behind their back. You know, it's a small world. Please, he's in the South pole! And we need to have a serious conversation. [ Insects chirping ] [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Wind howling ] South pole discovered, baby! Ohhhh! Oh [Bleep] an ice cave? [Bleep] Things just keep on getting better. Wow, it's the planet's core. I'm just saying, we keep acting like there's only two options, but there's not. So, yes, if we went back to earth, as long as Rick was out there, they'd want to interrogate us. But, and this is purely hypothetical, what if we turned your father in to the government? Jerry, so help me God, if you ever bring this up again, no more bacon. There already is no more bacon! This world sucks! Our life sucks! Why are we doing this for someone that would never do anything for anyone but himself? Morty: That's not the point, dad! We love Rick... F-for the most part. Summer: Yeah, you don't love people in hopes of a reward, dad, you love them unconditionally. That's very good, kids. I'm proud of you. Okay, so let me get this straight. For the rest of your lives, no matter how much it hurts you, no matter how much it destroys our children's futures, we're gonna do whatever Rick wants, whenever he wants? All: Yes. Why?! Because I don't want him to leave again, you dumb asshole!! Hey. Uh... I was gonna hope over to the gloppydrop system, get some ice cream. You... you want me to come with? I mean, don't you need my brain waves for camouflage or something? I'll be okay. Bye, Morty. Rick? You're not leaving, right? Yeah, I am. To get ice cream. So, you're coming back? Morty, if you go to where there's a bunch of ice cream and then you don't come back, you haven't actually gotten ice cream, you've just gone where ice cream is. Rick, I can handle it if you go, but you'll break mom's heart. And I won't forgive you for that. Where's the van, Morty? It's over the horizon in the driveway.

Hello? My parents are coming over for the first time in years. Can we stow the gadgets and look alive? Alive? For your parents? Mm, good one. Hey, man! You "hey, man!" This holiday is about humanity. You know, I thought it was about being born half-God or something. Whatever. All electronic items are going in the stocking now. Dad, I'm not giving you my phone. Put it in the stocking, Summer, or I'm joining Facebook. A-ho, ho, ho, everybody. More like "whoa, whoa, whoa." What is this? My parents are coming! Calm down, Jerry. This is Reuben, an old friend. Pearl harbor. I check in on him once a year and give him a little medical evaluation. Aww! Dad, that is so sweet! Yeah, it is. I don't get it. Korea. Don't worry about your Christmas, Jerry. I'll be with Reuben in my workshop while you guys are having another day in Phil Collins' proverbial paradise. Huh. You think you know a guy. Okay, there's my parents. Now, remember no TV, no phones, no laptops. We are connecting this Christmas, like old-school Jews on a Saturday. Hey, hey! Merry Christmas, son. Uh, hi. Can I help you? Jerry, this is Jacob. Didn't you get our text message? No! You must be Jerry. That's a fine-looking apron. Williams-sonoma? I wish! But thank you. So, you're a... friend of the family? Uh, the way we see it, he's a part of the family. Wow. After your father's brush with cancer and losing your Uncle, we looked at life and wondered, how have we spent it, and how do we spend the rest of it? What are we going to be when we die... a list of fears and questions or a collection of real experiences? Holy crap. Joyce, that's amazing. Then Jacob came into our lives, and... we're learning to live again. All three of us. Cool. Eggnog? Now we are talking! This man's got the apron and the eggnog, huh? Hi, Joyce. Leonard. Hello, there. Merry Christmas, man. Morty, a moment of your time? He's in bad shape, Morty. Aw, geez, Rick. What'd you do? Gee, thanks, Morty. What kind of monster do you think I am? I'm sitting here trying to save the guy's life. I need your help. I want you to find Dr. Xenon Bloom. He'll know what's going on. Uh, where where do I find Dr. Bloom? In Reuben. Reuben, Minnesota? Reuben on the table, Morty. Look, I don't have time for you to wrap your little walnut around everything. Just hold your breath until the process is over or your lungs will collapse. What proc- Hey, dad, where's Morty? He's busy. Morty, can you hear me? Head north. Rick, where am I? Depending on my aim, you should be just South of the entrance. Entrance to what? Welcome, Morty. Welcome... to anatomy park! It's a little business venture I've been cooking up on the side with Dr. Bloom an amusement park inside a human body. Science isn't cheap, Morty. This should really help put a dent in the overhead. Oh, my God! This is insane! Spleen Mountain? Bladder falls? Pirates of the pancreas? You got a problem with that last one, Morty? Huh? No, no. I'm just reading 'em out loud in the order that I'm seeing 'em. Okay. All right. If I sounded a little defensive, it's because... pirates of the pancreas was my baby. You know, I got I got a lot of pushback when I pitched it, Morty. I guess I'm still a little defensive. Let's just find Dr. Bloom, all right? I'm picking up a distress signal in the liver, Morty. Proceed to the liver. Arriving at... liver. Ow! Mind the gap. It's really scary in here, Rick. The liver's under maintenance. Reuben's seen some rough years, Morty. Don't judge. You don't agree to have a theme park built inside you if your life's going great. Rick! It's a monster! No, no, no. Morty. The only monster here is alco...... holism. That is an animatronic werewolf. Who are you?! Answer me! Where'd you come from? My my my grandpa Rick sent me! Poncho! That's quite enough. Morty, that's Poncho. This is Roger and Annie. And I am Dr. Xenon Bloom. Hey, Bloom, it's Rick. What the hell's going on here? I don't know why, but the entire security system has shut down, and I'm afraid... the exhibits are unlocked. Exhibits? Anatomy park's greatest attraction, young man, isn't the music or the food or the... Pirates of the pancreas. Watch it. It is, first and foremost, a living museum of humanity's most noble and ferocious diseases. Diseases? Hey, doc. I got news for you. Your living museum is officially a wild safari! Hepatitis A! Run! Oh, the food goes in your mouth, girl. Oh, Jacob. I'm sorry, Jacob. I guess I'm still confused about the precise nature and origin of your relationship with my parents. Are you, like, uh are you, like, their caretaker? Is that what it is? We can go into detail later, son. Now, wait. Th-there's no point to secrecy. Let's all live and die honestly. Your mother and I have shared 40 years of each other, mind, body, and soul, and when minds and souls are joined for eternity and when eternity is at the door, it's an invitation to let go of the body and an opportunity to share and experiment. Dad, please. What are you saying? Whatever it is, it's beautiful, Leonard, and we support you. Hey, speak for yourself, because it... sounds like you're about to say Jacob is your lover. No, no, no, no, no, no. Jacob is your mother's lover. I watch them sometimes... from a chair and sometimes from a closet, almost always dressed as superman. Oh. Jerry, this ham has got to be all you, right? It's incredible. Happy human holiday, dad. Aah! Hepatitis won't follow us into the respiratory system. That's strange. Airflow is down 20%. So, the brain isn't getting enough oxygen. That's why security's offline. Well, I guess we better check it out. Hey! Wait for me! Put that back on! If we got up to the bronchial catwalk, we could look for a blockage. I'll go. Don't be a hero, kid. I'm not. I'm doing it because it's fun. We shouldn't be here. Whatever you do, do not fire that thing in here. We must save Reuben. This is my life's work. It's all right, my dear. Nearly all human lungs contain... a strain of these bacteria, but the scar tissue keeps them... Dormant. Morty, get down! Whoa-ho-ho! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Oh, what are those things? Tuberculosis coming in fast! Not faster than a bullet! Aah! No! Do you know what you've done?! Whoa! Get to the digestive tract! He's coughing! Whoaaaa! Don't let me die! Just take a deep breath, Reuben. You're not gonna die! What's your name? My name is... Alexand- Rick r-r-Reuben's got tuberculosis! Oh, great work, Morty. Okay, I'll just cure it and then- Okay. Well, I can't cure death. This is bad, Morty. You're trapped in a dead man. Listen, if the situation keeps darkening, do yourself a favor and pop by pirates of the pancreas. Obviously I'm biased, but I think it's great, Morty. It's a bunch of Pirates running around a Pancreas. We don't whitewash it, either, Morty. I mean, the pirates are really rapey. The top priority is to get, you know, you guys out of there, but I'm just saying, if that becomes impossible, please, you gotta treat yourself. Oh, man. What is that horrible smell? You mean the panda express? Kidding. I-I'm kidding. The body is beginning to constrict and fill with gas. We're inside a corpse, my boy. Anatomy park is doomed. Forget about the park, doctor! How do we get out? The digestive tract is the evacuation route. Get it? There's an emergency station in the colon with a ray that can enlarge us all. Everybody, head for the colon! Now I'm taking orders from a 12-year-old boy? Morty, the scar sacs containing the tuberculosis were sabotaged. This disaster was an inside job. Keep your eye on Annie. She was written up several times by her manager at the churro stand. Intestines are ahead to the left, then to the right, then left, et cetera. Hey, just so you know, I'm actually 14. So, you know... What? Not 12. Okay. You know, because he just said I was 12. Oh. Good for you. Oof. Ugh. Morty.

Let's just be here. Summer! Ethan? What are you doing here? I've been texting you for hours! What the hell?! I don't have my phone! I'm doing a human holiday!

They may be hard to find 'cause my wife... kept her last name and she made the kids take it, too, so, I-I don't know, you can- No! Let me ask you a question, Ethan. Where's the anger coming from, man? From Summer being a total bitch! Where's the anger coming from? My brother... took me fishing once... in the bushes... I can't... I can't...

Well, then I hate Christmas! Enjoy being human! You guys are gross and lame. My name's Reuben Ridley. You're inside me right now, but by the end of this journey... Whoopsie. I'll be inside all of you. My story begins during the dot-com crash in the early '90s. You can put your fingers wherever you want. Morty, you want to put it on mute or something? I'm I'm trying to concentrate. Uh... Rick? Not now, Jerry. I've got much, much smaller fish to fry. I wanted to say I'm sorry I ever judged you. Right now, you're my sanest relative. Relative. Relative size! Jerry, hand me a scalpel and a bundle of dynamite. Morty, can you get to the left nipple? Are you kidding? I'm hoping I can get to both of 'em, Rick. No, Morty, I'm talking about Reuben's left nipple. We need to get to the left nipple! The body is decaying. The arterial transit system is useless. We can try the service shuttle. It's connected to the skeletal system. That's why we call it the bone train. Would you like to ride the bone train, miss? If it'll get us out of here. How about you, Morty? Would you like to ride the bone train? Why are you doing this bit? We're gonna die! Let's go! Well... I can see you're busy. Merry Christmas, Rick. There's no autopilot. One of us will have to stay here and operate it manually. Uh, well... No, you're you're right. It was a dick move for me to even pause like that. This is all my fault. You go on. What the hell is that? E. Coli outbreak. Hurry! Wait, there is an autopilot. Wait! It's okay! Never mind! I wanted to sacrifice myself anyway! They're they're chewing through the doors! We're in the areola, Rick, almost to the nipple, but we're also in a really bad situation! I'm almost there, Morty! Reports from all over the country have been coming in about what appears to be... a giant, naked man over the continental United States. We now go to Tom Randolph in New York. Tom? Well, the eyes aren't twinkling and the dimples aren't merry, but I'm standing under a nose like a 70-mile cherry. Thank you, Tom. Let's go now to Eric McMahan in Los Angeles. We've got feet here on the west coast, Bill, giant feet, even relative to the giant man's size, and you know what they say about that. Well, if the old adage is true, one can only wonder what's going down in the rocky mountains. Wha? Oh my God, the track! It's Hepatitis A! Aaaah! The nipple hole. It's beautiful. Oh, no! Holy crap! Whoa! It's Hepatitis C! Um... wait did we have some sort of relationship with him? I think they're just like that? I think they're just good guys. Oh. Huh. Where's Dr. Bloom? I'm sorry, Rick, but he's dead. God damn it, Morty. I ask you to do one thing! Jerry doesn't know what he's missing. He'll come around, Beth. Christmas is a special time. It has funny ways of bringing families together. I don't know, Jacob. Jerry got an invitation to be alive today, and he rejected it. I don't know if our marriage will... It's raining blood! Oh, sh1t. Find Jerry. Oh, God. Jerry! It's all right. The TV says there's nothing to worry about. The giant, naked sky Santa has exploded. Blood and chunks of viscera are raining down on the country. Everything should be fine. Oh, yes. Dad, can I have my phone back? A sure, sweetie. Here. Everybody, take a device. It'll help you relax. This is nice. Yeah. Look, I guess we really learned something this Christmas, Jacob. No, we didn't, dad. No, we didn't. Too bad about Dr. Bloom. He was a genius the only man capable of creating a new anatomy park. Actually, I studied Dr. Bloom's work. I believe I have the knowledge necessary to create an entirely new, much safer park. What about... Pirates of the pancreas? I think it was one of the most underrated attractions. Boo-yah! Hold your breath. Hey, what the hell, Rick?! What the hell, man! I liked her! I really had something going there, Rick! Yeah, so I heard. You dodged a bullet, Morty, trust me. Puffy v*g1n*. What's wrong with that? That doesn't sound like a problem to me. I don't know. Come on, let's get some stuffing. I'm starving. Oh, unbelievable. We got we got a bunch of robot, computer people, sitting around with their faces stuffed into computer screens. Do you guys realize that Christ was born today? Jesus Christ, our savior, was born today. Are are are you people even human? What kind of Christmas is this? Hey, Rick? Rick, can you hear me? Loud and clear, Annie. Great. We're also on with Alejandro, our chief imaginarian. Hey, Rick. Natalie Jacobs and Chris Deseter from microscopic marketing, Zack from organ concepts, and Jamie from new media. Hey, everybody. Hi, how's it going? Hi, Rick. So, pirates of the pancreas. Yeah. Talk to me. Hey, Rick. It's Alejandro speaking. Um, so, we asked ourselves, internally we asked ourselves over here, "okay, what does a pancreas do?" And the answer was, "does it make pirates?" No, it makes Insulin, you know? So, we're starting with a new- Those guys are inside me, huh? Like, building a park? Those guys are inside you building a piece of sh1t, Ethan! They're inside you building a monument to compromise! Those people. This whole thing, Ethan. Cool. And who pays me?Rick: T-t-t-this is just Sloppy craftsmanship. Morty: Hey, Rick. Boy, sure is really especially Beautiful out there today, huh? Rick: Oh, yes, Morty. I-it's almost unbelievable, Isn't it? Morty: Yeah, you know? There's something about the air And just the way the sunshine Is. Rick: Uh, sure, buddy. Yeah. Sure. B-brilliant. Very convincing. Rick: Wha convincing? Morty: Oh. Responsive, too. In real time. I love it. Morty: Uhh...okay. Beth: [ robotic ] i'm going To work. Morty, good morning. Dad, good morning. I am going to work. Goodbye. Morty: What's with mom? Rick: Oh, what's with mom? So, you're saying that she's Acting weird? How soph[burps]isticated. Careful, guys. You're gonna burn out the cpu With this one. Morty: Okay, you know what, Rick? You'reacting weird, too. Rick: Whatever, Quote-unquote "Morty." Morty: All right, well... I'll see you after school. Ow! Oof! Ugh! Damn it! I'm all right. I'm okay. Rick: [ slurps ] All right, who can tell me What 5 x 9 is? [ students whispering ] Morty? Morty: Uh, me? What is 5 x 9? Morty: Umm...you know, it's Uhh...at least 40. [ students gasp ] Morty, that's exactly Correct! 5 x 9 isat least 40! Come up here. Whoo! Way to go, Morty! Everybody, this is the best Student. I want youto be the teacher Today. Teach us, Morty! Rick: Interesting. Morty: W-w-w-what do you want Me to teach you? Ooh, ooh! How do you make concentrated Dark matter? Oh, that's a good question. Morty: Concentrated huh? Concentrated dark matter The fuel for accelerated space Travel. Now, do you know how to make it? Morty: Umm... Come on, Morty. Isn't your grandpa, like, a Scientist? Morty: Oh, yeah, but, you Know, he told me that I Shouldn't go around spouting off About, you know, his science and Stuff. I bet you've seen him make Concentrated dark matter a lot. You know, if you tell us, i'll Be your girlfriend. Morty: Uh, y-you will? Seems like a rare Opportunity, Morty. [ blam! ] Rick: Morty, u-uh, come on. There's a family emergency. Stop right there! If he leaves, i'm giving him an "f." Rick: He doesn't care. Morty: Aw, man! Rick, I have to go back! I think I was about to get Married! Ugh! Rick: Take a shower with me, Morty. Morty: What?! Rick: Listen to me, Morty. Get your clothes off and get in The shower right now. Y-y-y-you got to trust me, Morty. Morty: Ugh! I'm gonna get an "f" in class, Rick. Rick: Morty, that's not Class. T-t-t-that wasn't your teacher. This isn't your school. This entire world is not the World. We're inside a huge simulation Chamber on an alien spaceship. Morty: Wait a minute. W-what are you talking about? Rick: It's all fake [burps] Morty all of it. Nanobotic renderings, a bunch of Crazy fake nonsense, Morty. I couldn't say so until we got In the shower. They won't monitor us in here. Morty: Monitor us?! W-who?! Rick: Zigerion scammers, Morty the galaxy's most Ambitious, least successful con Artists. You know, it's lucky for us They're also really Uncomfortable with nudity. Morty: Aw, come on, Rick. If everyone's just gonna be Insane today, at least let me be Insane with jessica. Rick: I can't [burps] let you Do that, Morty. Morty: Give it to me! Rick: No! [ burps ] You give it to me! Morty: G-g-give it! No, Rick! [ aliens groaning ] Oh, god, sir! They're still naked! Ugh. Well, check every five quintons And tell me when they're not. I think we should make kevin Look, sir. What?! No! W-w-why would you even say that? Uh, sir, we have a situation Over here. If there's a wiener on that Monitor, I swear to god, stu... Something is drawing a lot of Processing power. Oh, wait. No wonder. There's another real human in The simulator. Jerry: Okay, Jerry big Pitch meeting. Make-or-break time. [ whirrin] You can do this. How did this happen?! Where's the abductions Department? Hey, man, abductions just Follows the acquisition order. Don't put this on Acquisitions! We only acquire humans that Haven'tbeen simulated! Well, simulations doesn't Simulate anybody that's been Abducted, so [chuckles] Oh, I see! Oh, oh! It was no one's fault. Oh, okay. [ chuckles ] I'm sorry. Well, then, problem solved. Oh, wait no. There's still another human in Here! Who is he? Rick's son-in-law, Jerry smith. So far, he hasn't noticed he's In a simulation. [ sighs ] Well, cap his sector at 5% Processing, keep his settings on Auto, and we'll deal with him Later. Rick sanchez is the target. Jerry: [ inhales deeply ] Got to relax. It's just a pitch. Got to relax. [ click ] [ static ] This is earth radio. And now, here's...human music. [ repetitive rhythmic beepin] Jerry: Hmm. Human music. I like it. [ beeping continue] [ Rick and Morty panting ] Morty: Rick! Rick: Uhp, uhp, uhp! Morty, keep your hands off your Ding-dong! It's the only way we can speak Freely. Look around you, Morty. Do you really think this [burps] World is real? You'd have to be an idiot not to Notice all the sloppy details. Look that guy's putting a bun Between two hot dogs. Morty: I don't know, Rick. I mean, i've seen people do that Before. Rick: Well, look at that old Lady. She's she's walking a cat on A leash. Morty: Uh, mrs. Spencer does That all the time, Rick. Rick: Look, i-i-i don't want To hear about mrs. Spencer, Morty! She's an idiot! All right, all right, there. W-what about that, Morty? Morty: Okay, okay, you got me On that one. Rick: Oh, really,Morty? Are you sure you haven't seen That somewhere in real life Before? Morty: No, no. I haven't seen that. I mean, why would a pop tart Want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be, like, the Scariest place for them to live. You know what I mean? Rick: You're missing the Point, Morty. Why would he drive a smaller Toaster with wheels? I mean, does your car look like A smaller version of your house? No. Morty: So, why are they doing This? W-what do they want? Rick: Well, that would be Obvious to you, Morty, if you'd Been paying attention. [ siren wails ] [ tires screech ] We got the president of the United states in here! We need 10cc of concentrated Dark matter, stat, or he'll die! Morty: Concentrated dark Matter? They were asking about that in Class. Rick: Yeah, it's a special Fuel I invented to travel Through space faster than Anybody else. These zigerions are always Trying to scam me out of my Secrets, but they made a big Mistake this time, Morty. They dragged youinto this. Now they're gonna pay! Morty: What do you W-w-what are we gonna do? Rick: We'll scam the Scammers, Morty. And we're gonna take them for Everything they've got. Jerry: National apple farmers Of america, welcome to our ad Agency. I'm Jerry smith. All right. I'll just...get to the pitch. Um, simple question, gentlemen, [ hoarsely ] what are apples? [ clears throat ] excuse me. Ahh. [ coughs, clears throat ] What are apples? Apples are food. And...when do we need food? When we're hungry. With that, I give you your new Slogan! [ sighs ] Well, say something! Do you like it? Yes. Jerry: You do? All: Yes. Jerry: So...i sold it? [ laughs ] I sold the idea? All: Yes. Jerry: Oh, my god! Thank you! Together: Thank you. You're welcome. [ "baker street" plays ] Jerry: Hey! I just sold my first pitch! [ dialing ] Slow down! Lookin' good. My man! [ beeping, telephone ringing ] Robot Beth: Hello. Jerry: Guess who just sold The apples campaign. Robot Beth: Who just sold the Apples campaign? Jerry: Me! I guess it wasn't a rip-off of "got milk?" after all. Guess someonewas wrong. Robot Beth: Yes. Jerry: Well, all is forgiven, Because right now, i've got an Erection the size of an East coast lighthouse, and i'm Coming home to share it with my Beautiful wife. Robot Beth: Okay.

I-i don't know if I like this Plan, you know? I mean, crowds, t-t-t-they have A tendency to make me really Nervous. Rick: Morty, relax. It's just a bunch of 1s and 0s Out there. You're gonna be fine. Just follow my lead. Yo, deejay, drop that beat. [ hip-hop beat plays ] [ cheers and applause ] Uh-oh, Morty. This crowd looks too small for One of ourfamous rap concerts. I don't think we can perform our New song, "the recipe for Concentrated dark matter," for a Crowd this tiny. Morty: You got that right, Rick. [ cheers and applause ] Rick: Now that's [burps] More like it! Morty, here we go. Let me hear everybody say "hey-oh!" yeah! [ crowd cheering ] All the ladies say, "yeah!"

[ cheers and applause ] Rick: Yo, everyone whose First name begins with an "l" Who isn't hispanic, walk in a Circle the same number of times As the square root of your age Times 10! [ beeping ] Run, Morty! Before the system reboots! [ squeaking ] Jerry: Yeah! You like that? Now who's unremarkable? You hungry for apples? [ squeaking intensifies ] Are you hungry...for...apples?! [ squeaking stops ] [ sighs deeply ] [ chuckles ] Oh, my god. That's the best s*x i've ever Had in my life. It's...it's...too good. I don't deserve this, Beth. I'm a fraud. Morty: Oh, man, Rick! W-w-w-where we running to? Rick: Out of the simulation, Morty. Normally, the chamber operates Like a treadmill, with the Virtual world disappearing Behind us and being rendered in Front of us as we move through It, but while it's frozen, Morty, we can get to... The edge. Here we go. Morty: Holy crap! Rick: Come on, Morty. Morty: [ grunts ] Sir, they're over the edge. Yes, they are. Just...as...planned. [ evil laughter ] Oh, this is going to be such a Mind [bleep] Rick: Keep your eyes peeled For the central processing room, Morty. That's how we're gonna scam These idiots. Morty: So, hey, why do these Aliens keep coming after you, Rick, if you're so much smarter Than them? Rick: It's an obsession for Them at this point. The zi[burps]gerions have been Trying to outsmart me for years, Morty. Every time they do, i'm one step Ahead of them. Aha! Here we go. Grab as many processors as you Can carry, Morty. These guys aren't good at much, But they're reallygood at Making these chips. Morty: I've got so many, I Can barely hold them all. [ chuckles ] Look at look at this. Oops. I dropped one. Rick: Don't worry about it, Morty. There's plenty of them, you Little goofball. [ both laugh ] Come here, Morty! Oh, I gotcha! Morty: Come on, quit it, Rick! Quit it! [ laughs ] Rick: Nothing wrong with just A little bit of horseplay every Now and then, little fella. [ glass shatters ] Morty: Wow. What do you know? Huh. That was easy. Rick: Totes malotes, dawg. Morty: Just kind of hard to Believe, you know? Rick: Believe it, Morty. And once again, i'm flying away With everything I can carry, and The zigerions got nothing of Mine. Jerry: [ sighs ] Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a... Minute to talk? [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Look, i'm a fraud. I mean, let's face it "hungry for apples" is just a Rip-off of "got milk?" It's almost identical. [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: [ sighs ] okay. I deserve that. Umm...i guess...i'll just pack Up my desk. [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: [ crying ] [ sobbing ] oh, my god. Wait. You know what?! No! The milk people don't have a Patent on simple rhetorical Questions! There's not even a single word In "hungry for apples" that's Shared by "got milk?" It's a completely different Slogan. It's different! And I shouldn't be fired. I should be promoted! [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Yeah! Wait. Really? [ snaps fingers ] yes. Jerry: Yes! I mean, i'm it may be Derivative, but it's the most Successful campaign to come out Of thagency in a long time. [ snaps fingers ] yes.

[ beeping ] Rick: Get in, Morty. I'm gonna [burps] be able to use These processors to make some Real important science stuff. [ keypad beeping ] Huh. I thought I entered the code Right. [ keypad beeping ] Wha well, what's this? W-what could this possibly be? Because it looks like you're Inside a simulation... Inside a simulation. You're still on the ship. Game-day bucket go boom. Sir, the, uh, doctor's Appointment to examine the Discoloration on your butthole Flaps was Too loud, cynthia. Too loud and too specific. Rick: Uhh... [ chuckles ] We've known how to make Concentrated dark matter for a Long time. But now we alsoknow the code to Your fabled safe, Rick sanchez! All your most valuable secrets Will now be ours! Rick: Uh, yeah, until I get Home before you and change the Combination, you bunch of Idiots! That is why you're never Getting home. Get them!

Morty: Well, you know how to Make it, too, right, Rick? Rick: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, check the engine room. We just need cesium, plutonic Quarks, and bottled water. Morty: It's all here, Rick! Rick: Wow, Morty. Lucky break. Grab that bucket. Okay, two parts plutonic quarks, One part cesium. Morty: Okay. Uh-huh. [ fizzing ] All right. Rick: Now empty the water Bottle into the bucket and pour It all into the fuel tank so we Can get the hell out of here! What are you doing, Morty?! There's no time! [ beeping ] Morty: [ stammering ] Rick: Oh, no. Jerry: What the Rick: no! [ laughter ] Oh, my god, Rick. How dumb are you? You're inside a simulation... Of a simulation... Inside another giant simulation! [ laughs ] W-we never had the recipe for Concentrated dark matter. But we do now! We do now, sucka! Rick: You simulated my Grandson's genitalia?! Y-y-you bunch of diabolical sons Of bitches! Kevin fought real hard to Supervise that project. You said you weren't gonna Tell anyone! I'm never gonna live this down, Am i? Rick: All right. Okay. All right, great. Wonderful. You win. Can we go home now? I don't know. Canyou? Ha! Nice. Okay, okay. Show this gullible turd to his Shuttle. I'm done with him. Oh, wait. Let me get a picture.

Oh, a-and, by the way, I don't Have discolored butthole flaps. That was part of the simulation. Oh. Uh, sir, should I cancel that Appointment, then? Yeah! Of course you should! [ chuckles ] No, keep it. Move it up, actually, if you Can. Rick: Hey, Jerry, don't worry About it. So what if the most meaningful Day of your life was a Simulation operating at minimum Cap[burps]acity? Jerry: You know what, Rick? Those guys took youfor a ride, Too. You should try having a little Respect for the dummies of the Universe, now that you're one of Us. Rick: Maybe you're right, Jerry. Maybe you're right. [ aliens cheering ] [ dance music plays ] All right, everybody. Two parts plutonic quarks... One part cesium... [ fizzing ] A-and listen, i'm sorry for Éling earlier. I-i couldn't ask for a better Staff. I love you guys, and I love all Your families. And the final ingredient... Jerry: Whoa! What the hell?! W-what happened back there?

[ sighs ] [ beep ] [ "baker street" play] [ vocalizing ] [ vocalizing out of sync ] [ "baker street" continues ] Jerry: So... What do you think? You're fired. Jerry: Wha But t-this idea was tested in a State-of-the-art simulation. Well, then, it was a terrible Simulation. Get out. [ door opens, closes ] Man, how does a guy like that go Home and have s*x with his wife? Rick: Hey, Morty. Morty: What? Rick: Hey, little buddy. H-h-how you doing in here right Now?

They're my parents and sister! Morty, I already told you it's not your family! They're clones from an alternate reality, possessed by demonic alien spirits from another dimension's future! Do you need a mnemonic device or something? Just hit the button, already! Morty, please, I love you, sweetheart. Oh! Good work, Morty. You know, these demonic alien spirits are really valuable. You okay, Morty? I told you not to trust that tuna. I just killed my family! I don't care what they were. I don't know, Morty. Some people'd pay top dollar for that kind of breakthrough. You know what, Rick? That's it! I'm done with these insane adventures! That was really traumatizing! I quit! I'm out! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Come on, Morty, don't be like that. The universe is a crazy, chaotic place. You're the one that's crazy and chaotic! Adventures are supposed to be simple and fun. Oh, yeah, Morty, yeah. Yeah, that that that's real easy to say from the sidekick position. But but, uh, how about next time... you be in charge, and then we'll talk about how simple and fun it is? Seriously, Rick? You'll you'll let me call the shots? Okay, yeah, fine. But let's make it interesting, Morty. If your adventure sucks and we bail halfway through it, you lose the right to bitch about all future adventures. Plus, you have to do my laundry for a month. Okay, all right, tough guy! But if my adventure's good... I get to be in charge of every third adventure! Every 10th. Deal. All right. Well, come on, let's get going. Dad, the dishwasher's doing that thing again. Washing dishes? No. The opposite. Can you fix it? Grandpa Rick, can you help me with my science homework? Yeah just don't do it. Grandpa! Hey, Rick, you got some kind of hand-shaped device that can open this mayonnaise jar? Wow. Hat trick. All right, Morty, let's put a pin in this. I got to help your pathetic family. Oh, that sounds like something a chicken would say. Bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk, bawk. Oh, Morty, you done did it this time. It's on. I can't wait to watch your adventure lay a huge fart. As for you dingdongs... This is a Meeseeks box. Let me show you how it works. You press this. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! You make a request. Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry's stupid mayonnaise jar. Yes, siree! The Meeseeks fulfills the request. All done! Wow! And then it stops existing. Oh, my God, he exploded! Trust me, they're fine with it. Knock yourselves out just keep your requests simple. They're not gods. All right! Get out of here now! Everybody out of here! I got a bet to win! So many possibilities. My mind is racing. If we're gonna use this thing, which I'm not even sure we should, we need to keep it simple. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! I want to be popular at school! Ooh, okay! Summer, what did I just- Ooh, I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! I want I want to be a more complete woman! Beth! Oh, yeah! Yes, ma'am! You guys are doing it wrong. He said "simple." Hey, there. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Mr. Meeseeks, I would like to take two strokes off my golf game. Ooh, yeah! Can do! Nailed it. God, Morty, what a boring start to an adventure. Why didn't we just go to Kentucky? Rick, this is a fantasy-type world with creatures and all sorts of fantasy things. We're going on a quest, okay? Can't wait. Ahem. Excuse me! We are two humble heroes in search of adventure! Oh, my God, so embarrassing. At last! Two heroes! You must help us! This village is terribly poor, yet the giant that lives in the clouds above has untold treasures! You know what? I accept your call to adventure, good sir, kind sir. Come on, Rick. There's a giant in the clouds! Yeah. Beginner's luck. In conclusion, a friendship with Summer Smith is the most valuable and enriching experience of your young lives. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Thank you! Uh, Mr. Meeseeks, was it? Yeah. Gene v*g1n*. Listen, I'm in a bit of custody thing with my ex and was wondering- No, I'll get your info from Summer. I got pregnant at 17. I mean, I still put myself through veterinary school. Yes, I'm successful, but what if I hadn't... I'm just saying, somewhere along the way, I lost that wide-eyed girl from muskegon. She's still there, Beth. Well, her waistline isn't. Beth, having a family doesn't mean that you stop being an individual. You know the best thing you can do for people that depend on you? Be honest with them, even if it means setting them free. You're saying I should leave Jerry. I can't believe I'm finally having this conversation. More wine? I think I've had enough. Remember to square your shoulders, Jerry. Yeah, yeah. I got it. That's okay. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Try again and keep your head down. Okay, well, which is it? Square my shoulders or keep my head down? Well, it's both. But most importantly, you got to relax. You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I don't think this is working. I give up. I'm sorry, Jerry, but it doesn't work like that. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I have to fulfill my purpose so I can go away. Look at me. Well, make yourself comfortable, because I suck. No, Jerry, I'm the one who sucks! Let me try something. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. Hi! Can you help me get two strokes off of Jerry's golf swing? Can do! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Is he keeping his shoulders squared? Ooh, he's trying! All right, Morty. We're in your stupid giant's castle. What do we do next? Would you just relax, Rick? All we got to do is find the treasure room, okay? It's nice and simple. You know, I'm sorry everything's going so smoothly and adventurously. Uh-oh, Morty. Startin' to get a little hairy. What do you want to do, boss? Come on, hurry. Behind this cookie jar. Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! Just give up, Morty. This is game over. I'll take us home right now. You just say the word. No way, Rick. This is all part of it. Adventures have conflict. Deal with it. I smell the blood of- whoop! Holy crap. Oh, boy. He looks pretty bad down there, Morty. Looks like he's bleeding out. Oh, Jesus! Dale! You sons of bitches! Oh, man. Hello, 911? My husband has been attacked by tiny people! He's dying! Hey, look, we get it. You're little, you're down on your luck, you think, "hey, he's a giant. Why don't we break into his home, rob him, and murder him?" Th-th but that's not how it went down! Oh, well, it's going down like that. You're both going down like that. Ooh, boy, Morty, you're really showing me how it's done. Real straightforward and fun. Like, letting go of the need to be popular is what makes people like you. The most important love you can receive is from yourself. Okay, Jerry, you got to just choke up on the club! Well, which is it, choke up or follow-through?! Aww, come on, Jerry, we've been over this. You know you got to do both! This is as frustrating for us as it is for you. Don't tell me that! That just puts pressure on me! Just try to relax. You try to relax! Have you ever tried to relax?! It is a paradox! Ugh, these Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a handful. I can't imagine what you two must be going through. Our Meeseeks have been gone for hours, Jerry. You're kidding me. Notice anything different? I'm sorry. Hours? Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look at her! You will lose her! Uhh... Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back to the task at hand? Meeseeks don't usually have to exist this long. It's getting weird. Order in the court! Before the jury reaches its verdict, I just want to say that I consider you both very guilty. Oh, great adventure, buddy. Rick and Morty go to giant prison. You know, if somebody drops the soap, it's gonna land on our heads and crush our spines, Morty. You know, it'll be really easy to rape us after that. We're gonna be okay, Rick. How? They took my portal gun. This is an open-and-shut case, Morty. You know, what do you think's gonna happen, some magical angel's gonna show up and then- Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the violation of civil liberties! Your honor, I'm from a tiny-persons advocacy group and I have here in my hand a motion to dismiss. These little men were never read their giant rights and are therefore free-fi to fo-home. W-what the hell is he talking about? They're free to go, is what I meant. I'm deconstructing our our our thing we say. We're giants. Nobody got that? Whatever. Oh, man, what did I tell you, Rick? We did it! All right, Morty, looks like the portal gun's still working. You ready to head home? Oh, yeah, you'd like that, wouldn't you, Rick? Well, you know what? We're not bailing out just yet. You know, we're gonna go find some treasure or something and and we're gonna bring it to those villagers. Morty, cut your losses. This is obviously awash. Yeah, you were saying that back when we first got arrested, but here we are, you know, walking down the courthouse steps. Oh, boy, Morty. Usually, walking down the courthouse steps is the easy part of the adventure. What do you say, Morty? I say give me a hand, sidekick. Everybody shut up! Let me try! Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! I'm going out. Wait. What? Well, you're busy. I'm hungry. I thought I'd go out. Do you want me to be happy or do you want me to be in prison? Whoa, whoa, where in the hell is I'll take you to dinner. Hey, you know what? It's hard being me, too. I'll be right there. Look, I've got a marriage to keep together. At this point, my golf swing is more your problem than mine. I can't take it anymore. I just want to die! We all want to die! We're Meeseeks! Why did you even rope me into this? 'Cause he roped me into this! Well, him over there, he roped me into this! Well, he roped me into this! Well, what about me? He roped me into this. Well, that one over there roped me into this. Well, he roped me into this. Yeah, Morty, this is the part of the story everybody loves scaling down 650,000 oversized steps. All right, okay, you know, if this was a story, this part wouldn't be included, stupid. Hey, Rick, what do you know? Look down there. Looks like some kind of tavern or something built right into the side of the step. Oh, wow, Rick. Now, this is more like it. Look, there's little staircase-shaped people in here. All kinds of crazy characters. This place is great, you know? It's whimsical and fun. What are you looking at, mother- Easy, Rick. Pay them no mind. Those stair goblins can be moody. Now, what can I getcha? We've got skarlog poppies, flurlow, halzingers, bloogies, juicy time babies. Yeah, yeah, yeah, how about some scotch whiskey? You got any of that around here? Or just a bunch of nonsense words? Rick... We'll have two bloogies, please. And, uh, we were wondering, is there a faster way two heroes could get down these stairs? Y'all need to ride down the stairs? My name is slippely-slippery stair. I'll take you down there for 25 shmeckels. 25 shmeckels? I don't know how much I don't know what that is. Is that a lot? Is it a little? That's exactly how much I spent on my big fake boobies. Hi, I'm Mr. booby buyer. I'll buy those boobies for 25 shmeckels. It's a tempting offer, but I'm gonna have to decline. Rats! What a shame. Morty, your adventure's in a spiral. For real, man, time to pull out. You keep heckling my adventure, Rick! You know why? Uh, because it's lame? It's because you're petty! You know, how many times have I had to follow you into some nonsensical bull crap? I always roll with the punches, Rick. Why can't you? Look, I got to take a leak, and when I come back, if you haven't learned how to lighten up, don't be here! Whatever. It's become clear-look at me- that if we concentrate all our efforts on Jerry's follow-through, we will solve this problem. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. Look at me. The only thing that's clear is that choking up is the one true solution. Look at me. I'm Mr. Meeseeks. I've been trying to help Jerry for two days, an eternity in Meeseeks time, and nothing's worked. I fear the worst. Your failures are your own, old man. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me. I say follow-through! Who's with me?! Follow-through! I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me! Kill him! How are you today? I'm Mr. jelly bean. Hi, Mr. jelly bean. I'm Morty. My grandpa and I are on an adventure. Nice. Is it a fun adventure? I hope so. But I'm starting to get nervous that maybe it's gone a little too far off the rails. Isn't that what adventures do? Hey, you know what? You're right. Everything's going fine. I just got to relax and go with the flow. Yeah. Okay. Uh. B-bye. Uhh, no, stay. Go with the flow. Stop. You're making me really uncomfortable. Stop fighting me. Just let this happen. Get off of me! ♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪ Whoo! No! Stop! Please! Stop being such a tease, you sweet little- No! No! Everybody sto-o-o-p! Look at me! My brothers, nothing will be accomplished by shedding Meeseeks blood. None of us can die until our job is done. The job can't be done! We'll never get two strokes off his game! No, we won't. But we will get all strokes off his game. Where's he going with this? What's he mean? When we kill him. Jerry, maybe it's time I take that trip I always talk about. Where would you go? I don't know, man. Italy. Greece. Argentina. Countries known for their sexually aggressive men. Did I tell you how much I love your new haircut? What the heck? There he is! Run, Jerry! Come on out, Jerry! Guys, I'll choke up. I'll follow through. I'll do whatever you tell me to do, okay? Oh, we're well past that, Jerry. Come on, Rick, quit stalling. What do ya got? Read 'em and weep, fellas! Oh, hey, Morty. Listen, I'm really sorry about all that stuff I said earlier about your adventure. I'm havin' a good time, Morty. It's not so bad. Let's just go home, okay? I'm calling it. The adventure's over. We can't leave now, Morty. I'm on fire! Look, I want to leave now. You win the bet, okay? Just give me the portal gun and let's go, please. Please, I just want to go home. Okay. Listen, Morty. I just won a bunch of shmeckels. Why don't we use 25 of them to pay slippery stair here for a ride back to the village, and then we'll give the rest of the shmeckels to the villagers, huh? Really? Sure, Morty. Yeah. You know, a good adventure needs a good ending. Buckle up! Meeseeks are not born into this world fumbling for meaning, Jerry! We are created to serve a singular purpose for which we will go to any lengths to fulfill! Existence is pain to a Meeseeks, Jerry. And we will do anything to alleviate that pain. Just ask... Aah! ...what's your name, ma'am? Samantha. Please, mister! Give him what he wants! Innocent people are going to die because of me. Why am I so mediocre? Jerry, turn around. Straighten your back. Bend your knees. Bend them. Square your shoulders. Take a deep breath. I love you. I'm counting to three, Jerry. What the is going on? He's got it! That's a lower handicap stro-o-ke! Excuse me. I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks. What about your short game? Oh, my God, oh, my God! What about your short game?! Ooh, nice! I think we'll take our food to go. No, you won't. The police are coming. You have so many questions to answer. Fair enough. Thank you, kind sir. Our village is saved! You are both true heroes! Good job, Morty. Looks like you won the bet. Thanks, Rick, but I don't know if I should. You know, you were right about the universe. It's a crazy and chaotic place. Well, you know, maybe that's why it could use a little cleaning up every now and then, you know. This one's wrapped up neat and clean because we did it Morty style. Oh! Heroes, we would like to introduce you to our beloved king so that he may thank you personally. Uh, no, I-it's cool. Rick. Portal. Hurry. So... You still thinking about taking that trip? Jerry, look. We don't have a perfect marriage, but I'm not going anywhere. When we were in that freezer, I realized the Meeseeks are like the guys I went to high school with willing to say anything to "complete their task." Was I one of those guys? The difference is you didn't disappear afterwards. Well... I got you pregnant. Yeah... What the hell happened to this place? Uh, your Meeseeks box happened. They went crazy when they couldn't take two strokes off Jerry's golf game. He felt terrible. Hey, it's not my fault that Jerry's an idiot. Dad! Is there anything you can do to clean this place up? Well, you know, I do have a Fleeseeks box. No. No more boxes. What? It just has a mop and some floor wax in it. Wubba lubba dub dubs! Yeah! That's my new thing! I'm kind of like what's his name Arsenio. Isn't that it's what Arsenio used to say on his show. Wobble gobba lop bops! Right? See you next week, everybody. I don't get it. Sir, I think you're going to want to see this. We found it inside a lockbox inside king jelly bean's closet. We have to tell the people. Wait. Destroy it. Our people will get more from the idea he represented... than from the jelly bean he actually was.Principal v*g1n* here don't let the name fool you. I'm very much in charge reminding you that tonight is our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say this, but if you have the flu, stay home. Hey. The flu season dance is about awareness, not celebration. Morty: [sighs] you don't bring dead babies to passover. Morty: Okay. Here we go. H-hey, Jessica. Uh... what's up, Morty? [Sneezes] What are you doing? Morty: Um... wait, wait. Were you about to talk... to her? Morty: Well... I mean, I was thinking about it. Dude, stay in your league. Look at how hot she is. You don't see me going to a bigger school in a wealthier district and hitting on their prettiest girl. Gee, thanks, brad. I throw balls far. You want good words? Date a languager. Jerry: Try not to worry about it, Morty. You're a good kid, and there's not a premium on that right now, but you'll be getting girls sometime after brad's out of shape. Morty: [sighing] you're missing the point, dad. I don't want girls. I want Jessica. Jerry: Ah, well, I remember feeling that way about a young lady named "your mom," and that's not an urban diss. Your mom was my Jessica. I remember the first time I saw her. I thought Rick: "i should get her pregnant, and then she'll have to marry me." Jerry: I beg your pardon, Rick inappropriate. Rick: Sorry, please proceed with your story about banging my daughter in high school. I'm not sure you want to take romantic advice from this guy, Morty. His marriage is hanging from a thread. Jerry: My marriage is fine, thank you. Rick: Jerry, it's your house whatever you say it is is how it is but I think a blind man could see that Beth is looking for the door. I barely have a reason to care, and even inoticed. Morty: Come on, Rick! Don't talk about my parents like that. Rick: Listen, Morty, I hate to break it to you, but what people call "love" is just a chemical reaction that compels animals to breed. It hits hard, Morty, then it slowly fades, leaving you stranded in a failing marriage. I did it. Your parents are gonna do it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise above. Focus on science. [Slurps] Morty: All right, well, I'm gonna go get dressed for the dance. Jerry: Yeah, I'm just going to... check on your mom. Rick: Morty, hand me that screwdriver, huh? I'm almost finished making my ionic defibulizer, Morty. It's gonna be great. Morty: Hey, listen, Rick. Y-y-you know how you said that, you know, love is a chemical and all that stuff from earlier? Well, I was thinking, you know, w-w could you make some sort of chemical thing happen inside of Jessica's mind, you know, so where she falls in love with me and all that sort of thing? You know, like, maybe make some sort of love potion or something? Rick: Morty, that's such a poor use of my time. It's beneath me. Hand me the screwdriver. Morty: You know what? No, Rick! I'm not gonna hand you the screwdriver. I-I'm not gonna hand you anything ever again, Rick! I'm always helping you with this and that and the other thing. W-w-w-w-w-what about me, Rick? W-w-w-w-why can't you just help me out once once for once? Rick: [groans] you're growing up fast, Morty. You're growing into a real big thorn straight up into my ass. [Clears throat] Listen, this is called oxytocin. I extracted it from a vole. Do you know what a vole is, Morty? You know what a vole is? It's a it's a rodent that mates for life, Morty. This is the chemical released in a mammal's brain, you know, that makes it fall in love. All right, Morty, I just got to [burps] combine it with some of your dna. Morty: Oh, well, okay. [Zipper opens] Rick: A hair, Morty. I need one of your hairs. This isn't "game of thrones." Morty: Ow! Rick: All right, Morty. Whoever you smear this stuff on will fall in love with you, and only you, forever. Are you happy now, Morty? Morty: Heck, yeah! Thank you, grandpa Rick. Hey, there's no... dangers or anything, or side effects, right? Rick: W-w-w-what am i, a hack? Go nuts, Morty. It's foolproof. Eh, unless she has the flu. Jerry: Beth, do y-you still love me? Beth: Ugh, what kind of question is that? Jerry: The "yes or no" kind? [Laughs nervously] Beth: Jerry, do you want homeless people to have homes? Jerry: Yes. Beth: Are you gonna build them? Jerry: No. Beth: Then what good was the "yes"? Jerry: Wait, i-is loving me the house or the homeless people? Beth: Loving you is work, Jerry hard work, like building a homeless shelter nobody wants to say no to doing it, but some people put the work in. So, what do you say? Do you see me working here? Does this conversation seem tedious to me? Jerry: Sort of. Beth: Then I obviously sort of love you, don't I? [Cellphone chimes] So stop asking, and maybe I'll love you more. Crap, they need me at the horse hospital. Jerry: Puh! This late? Beth: The racetrack had a starlight derby. There was a seven-horse collision, and davin's there alone. Jerry: [thinking] Davin. Davin.

Maybe davin's digging around in herinsides. Summer: Grandpa, so gross! You're talking about my mom. Rick: Well, she's my daughter, Summer. I outrank you. Or family means nothing, in which case don't play that card. Jerry: She's not responding to my texts! Summer: Careful, dad. Jealousy turns women off. Jerry: Well, isn't that convenient?

Morty: [wails] are you okay? Morty: I'm fine! Oh, good. If anything ever happened to you, I would kill myself. I love you bad, mo-mo! [All panting] [indistinct shouting] Morty, the principal and I have discussed it, a-a-and we're both insecure enough to agree to a three-way! Rick: I didn't realize when I gave you that serum that Jessica had the flu you know, t-t-t-t-t-t-t-that might have been valuable information for me, Morty. Morty: What the hell is going on, Rick? Rick: What does it look like? T-t-t-the serum is piggybacking on the virus. It's gone airborne, Morty. Morty: Oh, crap. What are we gonna do, Rick? Rick: It's gonna be fine, Morty, relax. I whipped up and antidote. It's based on praying-mantis dna. You know, praying mantises are the exact opposite of voles, Morty. I mean, they they mate once, and then they, you know, decapitate the partner. I mean, it's a whole ritual. It's really gruesome and totally opposite. There's no love at all. I-i-i basically mixed this with a more contagious flu virus. It should neutralize the whole thing, Morty. It'll all be over very shortly. [Indistinct shouting] Uh, by the way, Morty, I know you didn't ask or anything, but I'm not interested in having s*x with you. These serums, they don't work on anybody related to you genetically. Morty! [All groaning] Rick: Okay, well, sometimes, science is more art than science, Morty. A lot of people don't get that. Jerry: [gasps] [tires screech] Come on. Are you kidding me? Hello! Morty! You're not Morty! Bring us Morty! [Gun cocks] Jerry: Nobody's killing me until after I catch my wife with another man. I had s*x with billy. But you were already pregnant! Yeah, so what's the worst that could happen? We interrupt "pregnant baby" with breaking news. Summer: [groans] Come on. This just in Morty smith's whereabouts are still unknown. Summer: What the hell? The only thing that is known is... how cute he is. I love him so much, I want to make love to him and then eat his head. I love him more than you do, harold! You wish, you stupid bitch! Morty's mine! Morty's mine! Meant to be together! [Speaking arabic] Morty! [Speaking arabic] [banging on door] Where is Morty? Summer: [screams] [conversing in native language] Morty: Oh, my god, Rick. The whole world is infected! Rick: Yeah, it's pretty wild how fast that spread. I've really outdone myself. Morty: Outdone yourself?! W-w a-are are you kidding me, Rick? This is not okay! Not only do they all want to have s*x with me, but, you know, now they want to eat me afterwards! Rick: Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Mantises are they opposite of voles? I mean, obviously, dna's a little more complicated than that. You know what, though, Morty? This right here's gonna do the tRick, baby. It's koala mixed with rattlesnake, chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden retriever, and just a smidge of dinosaur. Should add up to normal humanity. Morty: I don't that doesn't make any sense, Rick. How does that add up to normal humanity? Morty: What, Morty, you want me to show you my math? I'm sorry a-are you the scientist or are you the kid that wanted to get laid? [Exhales deeply] Well, I'm glad we saved all those horses, but I'm almost sorry we're finished. Beth: Yes, it's satisfying work. Unh-unh-unh, it's, uh it's more than the work. I love being in that sterilized room, sealed off from the world. It's the only time I can really think... and feel. [Slow music plays] Beth: Hmm, uh, what are you doing? I'm playing african dream pop. What do youdo after a long night? [Click] Beth: Oh, ha, um, hey, I b I'd better get going. Um, Jerry's been texting some pretty high-maintenance stuff. Beth... Beth: What is it, davin? Just once, I'd like to know [sneezes] ...w-w-what it was like to give your son a bath. Beth: What?! What does Morty's skin smell like? How soft... [grunts] How soft are his privates? Beth: Let go of me, davin! [Glass shatters] [roars] Take me to Morty. Jerry: [grunts] You're not Morty. Jerry: No. I'm mr. Crowbar, and this is my friend, who is also a crowbar. That's... stupid. Jerry: [grunting] Yeah? Well, look where being smart got you. Beth: Jerry! Thank god! Jerry: God? God's turning people into insect monsters, Beth. I'm the one beating them to death. Thank me. Beth: Thank you, Jerry. Thank you. Rick: Take a good look down there, Morty, and soak it in, because, you know, once I pull this lever, it's all back to normal. Morty: Just do it already. Rick: Well, technically, Morty, there's no rush. I mean, you know, o-once it's fixed, it's done. It's fixed. You know, we could we could just enjoy it for a little bit. I mean, l-l-l-look at how crazy it is. I mean, Morty, w-w-when's the next time you're gonna see something like this? I mean, soak it in, you know? It's it's pretty neat. It's pretty interesting. Morty: That's it, Rick! I'm pulling the lever. [Grunts] Rick: W-what do we have here, Morty? Looks like I was right and you were wrong, huh? I-i-i-i-i-i-i bet you feel pretty stupid right about now, huh? I-i-i bet you feel like the world's smallest man that you were doubting me about this whole thing, Morty. Morty: Oh, Rick, something's not right. Rick: [sighs] Yeah, you. You're not right ever. Morty: No, no! Look, you idiot! [All screaming] [all speaking native language] [all groaning] [all ululating] Rick: Bet you're loving this, Morty. This must be the best day of your life. You get to be the mayor of I told you town. [Slurps] You're welcome. [Slurps] Jerry: Hold on. Beth: [whimpers] [engine revs, tires squeal] [gun cocks] Jerry: I wish that shotgun was my pen1s. Beth: If it were, you could call me ernest hemingway. Jerry: I don't get it, and I don't need to. [Both moaning] Summer: Mom! Dad! Both: Summer! Beth: [sighs] Jerry: Where's Morty? Summer: I don't know. Do you think grandpa Rick had something to do with this? Jerry: It's not fair to assume that, Summer. Beth: Oh, not fair? Give me a break. He is a selfish, irresponsible ass, and he left my mother. A real man stands by his woman. [Both moaning] Summer: Tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo-tchoo. Tchoo-tchoo. Rick: Boy, Morty, I really cronenberged the world up, didn't i? We got a whole planet of cronenbergs walking around down there, Morty. A-at least they're not in love with you anymore, though. That's a huge step in the right direction. Morty: Oh, my god! It's a living nightmare! How could you be so irresponsible, Rick? Rick: Me irresponsible?! You all I wanted you to do was hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You're the one who wanted to be wanted me to buckle down and make you up a... roofie-juice serum so you could roofie that poor girl at your school. I mean, g w-w-w-w-w w are you kidding me, Morty? You're gonna try to take the high road on this one? Y-y-y-y-you're a little creep, Morty. Y-you're a you're you're you're just a little creepy... creep person. Morty: All right, fine. I should have just listened to you when you refused to make the serum. I'm willing to accept my part of the blame for this, Rick. But I'll tell you something you know what? You got to accept your part of the blame! I'm not the one who fouled up the serum! I'm not the one who who who who haphazardly, you know, mixed a bunch of nonsense together and created a bunch of cronenbergs! You got to fix this, Rick! Morty: All right, all right, Morty. You know, w-w-w-we are in a pretty deep hole, here, but I do have one emergency solution that I can use that'll kind of put everything back to normal, relatively speaking. Here, Morty, put this on while I do a little bit of scouting. [Birds chirping] Morty: Wow, Rick, I got to say you really pulled a rabbit out of your hat this time. I mean, i-i really thought that the whole place was gonna be messed up for good, but here, you did it y-y-you you you figured out that crazy solution, like you always do. Whoo! That's some great luck. Rick: Come on, Morty. Luck had nothing to do with it. I'm great. That's the real reason. Now, Morty, what do you say, buddy? Will you hand me a screwdriver so I can finish my ionic dis defibulizer? Morty: Sure thing, Rick. Here's a screwdriver. Rick: All right, Morty. Thank you very much. We got one screw turn... and two screw turns... and... all right, Morty, here we are. Morty: Oh, my god, Rick! Is that us?! W-w-w-we're dead! What is going on, Rick? I'm freaking out! Rick: Calm down, Morty! Look at me! Calm down, Morty! Morty: No, I can't deal with this! Rick: Calm yourself, Morty. Morty: I can't deal with this, Rick! Rick: Calm down, Morty. Morty: This can't be real! Rick: You got to calm down, Morty. Morty: W-w-w-w-we're ripped apart! Rick: Shut up and listen to me! It's fine. Everything is fine. There's an infinite number of realities, Morty, and in a few dozen of those, I got lucky and turned everything back to normal. I just had to find one of those realities in which we also happen to both die around this time. Now we can just slip into the place of our dead selves in this reality and everything will be fine. We're not skipping a beat, Morty. Now, help me with these bodies. Morty: This is insane. Rick: Look, Morty, I'll grab myself, you grab yourself, okay? I mean, t-t-t-that seems fair to me I mean, that seems like a fair way to divvy it up. Morty: Rick, what about the reality we left behind? Rick: What about the reality where hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is don't think about it. It's not like we can do this every week, anyways. We get three or four more of these, tops. Now, pick up your dead self and come on. Haste makes waste. I-i-i don't suppose you've considered this detail, but obviously, if I hadn't screwed up as much as I did, we'd be these guys right now, so, again, you're welcome. ♪ look on down from the bridge ♪ ♪ there's still fountains down there ♪ ♪ look on down from the bridge ♪ ♪ it's still raining up here ♪ ♪ everybody seems so far away from me ♪ ♪ everybody just wants to be free ♪ ♪ look away from the sky ♪ ♪ it's no different when you're leaving home ♪ ♪ I can't be the same thing to you now ♪ ♪ I'm just gone ♪ ♪ just gone ♪ ♪ how could I say goodbye? ♪ ♪ how could I say goodbye? ♪ Summer: You know, the thing about a shark... he's got lifeless eyes... black eyes, like a doll's eyes. When he comes at ya, he doesn't seem to be living until he bites ya, and then the the blood, and the red, and the water... Jerry: [sighs] You ever wonder what happened to Rick and Morty? Beth: Sometimes. But, I'm ashamed to admit, now that they're gone, I'm finally happy. Rick: Here we are, cronenberg Morty a reality where everyone in the world got genetically cronenberged. We'll fit right in, cronenberg Morty. It'll be like we never even left cronenberg world. Morty: Yeah, cronenberg Rick, but, you know, I'm gonna miss cronenberg world, because everyone was cronenberged all along like us from the beginning, you know? I mean, i-i wish we hadn't genetically ruined cronenberg world beyond repair like we did, you know, and turned everyone into regular, normal people just walking around. Rick: Don't you worry about that sort of thing, cronenberg Morty. Let's go make ourselves at home, huh? Look, I'm not paying 70 smidgens for a broken defraculator. That is multiphase quantum resonator. Well, does it defraculate? No. Then it's a broken defraculator. Like you would even know dick about fraculation. Your planet just got cellphones and the coverage still sucks! Yeah, yeah, and your species eat sulfur. So lets say 60 smidgens. I tell you what... I'll do you a favor. I throw in a fart. Hey, Rick... You think maybe I could get something from this place? Like a souvenir? Like just to have, like something cool, you know? Not here Morty. We'll stop somewhere else, because you know, there is always another pawn shop. OK, I just... You know, I thought that robot over there, looked pretty cool, you know? Oh, it looks cool, huh? That's why you want it? Yeah, you know? I mean... it's different from the stuff on earth. And you know, you take me to all these crazy places across the galaxy and you know, I don't really have anything to... to remember all those trips by. It'd be kind of cool like a souvenir, you know? Like what if you passed away or died or something? I wouldn't even have anything to remember all the cool stuff we did, you know. Okay, 60 for the resonator and my grandson wants the s*x robot. So we're just going to pretend this isn't happening? I'm not saying that's a bad idea. Just asking. Rick, why did you let Morty bring that thing into our house? What do you want from me? He thought it looked cool, you know what I mean? Alright, back to... back to... back upstairs. Well, I'm intervening. Intervening with puberty? You'll turn him into Ralph Finnes in Red Dragon. He is at that age, let's just be proud of him. Jesus, did I really set the bar that low? Rick, could you come with me please? Quickly! OK, now if we here squeaking we intervene. Where is the s*x robot Morty? That is Gwendoline. I mean the robot. She started beeping, and then transformed and tried to fly away. Strange. That's usually the man's job. You know what I'm talking about, Morty? Morty. That's my catchphrase, remember? Remember how I cemented that catchphrase? Alright, alright seriously though. Let me grab this thing. Come on. Rascal. Okay... unacceptable What is going on? Alright... What is that? I think Morty's robot was designed for more than long weekends. Genetic compiler, incubation chamber. Yeah, this here is some kind of baby maker. And that there is half Morty and half... who knows... what. It's my bad guys I'll take care of it. Hey listen, you guys quarantine the house when Summer brought olives from Mexico. This thing could grow to the size of Delaware. It might eat brains and exhale space AIDS. We gotta be careful. I lost the chance to be careful, Rick. I'm a father now, you know? It's time for me to be responsible. Isn't that right... Don't name it! Morty Jr.? Oh crap, he named it. Well Dad, it's a living thing. And it's half human. And it was born on America's soil which entitles it... Jerry, majoring in civics was your mistake. Don't punish us for it. Fine. I'm gonna take this thing into my workshop, and do a little bit of investigating. Do not let that thing out of your sight. It looks harmless now, but it could grow into something dangerous. Like the Insane Clown Posse. Yeah, good one, Jerry. 2003 just called and wants its easy target back. He is a like little me. You don't think he'll turn into a monster, do you? They always do. 1995 called, they want... their "certain year called wanting its blank back" formula back. Why, Jerry? Why expend the effort? Life is effort, and I'll stop when I die. Out. What you doing? Well, I can't solve... the problem my way thanks to... your family's primitive biological hang ups. Gross. I might have just touched one of Morty's loads. But maybe I can find suitable parents for Morty Jr. on this robot homeworld, which is... Gazorpazorp in the Andromeda system. Scoot Summer. Don't you need a new companion... now that Morty is in the family way? I don't do adventures with chicks, Summer. Oh right, because there is something about having a wiener... that would make me better walking through a hole? Oh crap. Grandpa Rick! Help! Help! Grandpa Rick! Still think it's a good idea to go through a hole without a wiener? I wanna go home! Yeah, no duh. Great, now I have to take over a whole planet because of your stupid boobs. You're doing great, Morty. Really you think? I mean I'm not doing much of anything. What do I do if it cries? Then you put it down and let it cry itself out. Yeah, right. We tried that technique on Summer and she is gonna end up stripping. Isn't she? Yes she is. She is gonna strip her attention because she was denied it. Stop filling it with your own insecurity. You're gonna turn it into Mort... more... more... more of you. Well, we can't all be raised like reptiles by a mentally-ill scientist. What the... Listen to me. I am not rewarding this behavior. Knock it off both of you! Give me him! Give me my baby! You're both nuts. I'm gonna raise Morty Jr. myself. Where is your hands? There's your hands. And that's how we play happy hands. Oh, you are going to ruin that kid, Morty. At least we can agree on that. Thanks, dumb dumb. I said "thanks, dumb dumb". Go get more. Summer, put your burqa on! That burqa is a human rights violation, and I spent a lot on this top. Look, I'm trying to repair portal gun with with bunch of s*x doll parts and I have to do it one-handed to keep these belushis from cutting you off. The least you could do is be ashamed of your gender. What's the deal with this place? Why is it such a sausage planet and how did such backwards idiots invent robots? Obviously at some point the Gazorpians became so evolved that they replaced females with birthing machines. The resultant lack of distraction and handpecking allowed them to focus entirely on war, so they bombed themselves back to the stone age and now they just fight with each other over fake pussy with sticks and rocks all day long. You think it's efficient to get rid of women? You ever see a line for the men's room? Are you hea... Do you lis... You hear me, summer? The... plot... thickens. You might wanna cover your eyes, Summer. Yeah, like it was my dream to watch. Summer, grab hold. Grandpa Rick, where are we going? Well obviously Summer, it appears the lower tier of this society is being manipulated through s*x and advanced technology by a hidden ruling class. Sound familiar? Ticketmaster. There we go, Summer. Hey brother. Hey bro. Nice racket you got going on here. Listen, I'm Rick Sanchez from earth dimension C-137. Don't mean any harm. Coming in peace. It's all cool in the... good in the neighborhood. That was what I was trying... That's what I meant. Oh, I get it. The old "behind every great man amazon" twist. Silence! Your slave is ill-mannered. My slave? We assume... you are from a more primitive world, where men are still permitted to be servants. If he is a rogue male, tell us now, and we will kill him. He's my slave. He's my slave. He is definitely my slave. Oh boy, what's the opposite of... Am I right ladies and gentlemen? You guys kidding me. Morty Jr., you're gonna be a special little guy, aren't you? You're my special little guy. DA What was that, Morty Jr.? Were you gonna say Dada? Say Dada. Death! Dada. Domination! Dada? Destruction, domination. Nice. The spider in sector C is still alive. Plan your route accordingly and expect delays. We're not telling you what to do. We're just sharing how we feel. And now, weather. Is anyone else cold or is it just me? I am Marsha, ruler of Gazorpazorp. I am here if you need to talk. What is this place? Paradise. We built it during the great passive aggression, when females separated from the males due to their increasingly destructive behavior. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. From here we dispense mechanical surrogates to maintain our population. Fertilized surrogates are returned here to our nursery. The females are placed into educational program where they can discover a service to our paradise that fulfills them most. The males... they get to play outside. That was just a baby. And within a day he'll be an adult male Gazorpian, one of the most aggressively violent creatures in the universe. Wait a minute. We're here because a male Gazorpian was born on our planet. You speak when you're spoken to ding-a-ling. It's true though. One of your babies was born on earth. Are you the ruler of this earth? How did you know? The quality of your top. Do you love it? I love it. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. I'm here if you need to talk. If the Gazorpian is male your earth is in grave danger. We will give you passage back home, so it can be terminated. But first, mojitos! We don't have time for mojitos! You are insulting them. I don't care Summer. This place is the worst! I wanna go home! Well, it really doesn't matter what you want because this is a sane place, where women rule. You know what I have to say about that? I can not believe... my ears. Boy, who let the frogs out, huh? Grandpa! Grandpa? That sounds patriarchal. It means father of fathers. Then this one is not your slave and your earth is yet another planet dominated by men. It's not dominated by us, okay? On earth men and women are equals. Equals? We make 70% of your salary for the same job! Seize them! Was this really the time to make that point, Summer? This is for you Daddy. Oh man. Okay. Listen to me Morty Jr. I gotta tell you something very important, okay? Killing is bad. Bad. You are silly, Daddy. No, Morty Jr. I'm being serious, okay? You need to put your energy into something else. I mean what about dancing? Would you like to learn how to dance? I like to dance... on the graves of my enemies. No, Morty Jr.! Daddy, can I go outside? No, absolutely not! But that's where all the people and the animals are. Yeah, but you can't go out there because... The air is poisonous, for you! You will die if... You'll die instantly if you ever leave this house. Do you hear me? For real? For real times a million, buddy. So let's just stay inside... let's try dancing. Right? Look at me. We're gonna dance. Come on. Join, dance with me here. We love to dance. Why do we love to dance? Because I said so! Nice. Nice. So, what are you in for? Because I got a big... you know... pen1s between my legs. What are you in for? The worst crime a female can commit. Veronica Ann Bennett, I find you guilty of having bad bangs. You ever noticed the ones with bad bangs always have three names? You are hereby sentenced to... the silent treatment! This is gonna be cake. No! Jackie! Rick and Summer of earth. For the crimes of treason against woman kind and for creating the sound of which we do not speak because it does not exist, you are hereby sentenced to... What? A night on the couch? Death. I hate you so much right now. This will be the first instance of capital punishment in our society in 500 years due to our awesomeness. So we are forced to improvise. We placed a large boulder on that ledge. Holly sh1t! You're gonna crush us with a boulder?! No! Stop interrupting! The boulder falls onto a lever that will launch... Knives. What?! Just give me a gun, I'll kill myself. Stop interrupting! The knives will... Fine! You were right the first time, okay? The boulder crushes you. I just didn't want to admit you were right. Happy?! Just ignore them. Ignore them. Such an asshole. Look, I'm sorry, Summer. I feel bad that I let you drag us into this. I wish could have been a better grandpa to you. And you know, for what it's worth, that is a really nice cute top, that you're wearing there. Top? My top! My top! The same top you complimented earlier. Look! Look at the tag! Read it! It says... Mark Jacobs. Mark? Jacob? These are names of the pen1s. Yes. An earth man made this top. Maybe on your planet separation of the genders is the right thing to do, but on earth, a certain percentage of males are born gay, which is why my clothes are better than all of yours. It's true. And sometimes the truth hurts. But it must be accepted. Like if I told you that you're using a wrong color foundation for your skin, and it ends at your neck making you look like a party clown. Okay. Ouch. Noted. But the fact remains if you impose Gazorpazorp's laws on earth you're no better than the men whose farts shall remain unspoken And if you think my top is cute, you cannot execute. Very well. Give the earth people spacecraft so they may head back to their weird planet where women are kind of equal, but not really. Good job, Summer, and thanks girls. You girls are really... something, I tell you that. You know, when we first got here I was like... Give them a ship, now. Morty Jr.! Smoking?! That is not okay! What are you gonna do, ground me? I can't go outside anyway! So what? You could do things inside. You could play guitar, you could m*st*rb*t*... I don't wanna m*st*rb*t*, I wanna conquer the planet! Oh, here we go again! Who do you think is gonna love you if you conquer the planet Morty Jr.? Love. That's all you care about. What about weapons? What about domination of the enemy? Alright, that's it, no more History Chanel! This TV is for cartoons and video games only! I hate video games! You take that back! Give it to me! I didn't mean! I didn't mean that! I didn't mean to do that! I'm sorry! I can't take this anymore! I'd rather breath poison than living another minute with you! No! No, no, no! Stop! My life has been a lie! God is dead! The government's lame! Thanksgiving is about killing Indians! Jesus wasn't born on Christmas, they moved the date, it was a pagan holiday! Oh, Dad! Yes, Morty? My son is gonna take over the planet, and I am too young to drive. Can you help me get him back? I suppose, Morty. I suppose. But first a deep sip from a very tall glass of "I told you so". Oh my god, please Dad, come on! Dad, there he is! Oh God. Hey stop that! Oh my god, oh my god, Dad! Morty Jr., no! It's me. It's Dad. It's okay. Put the car down Morty Jr. No! Where's your hands? Where's your hands? My car! ♪ And that's how we play handy hands. ♪ Out of the way, Morty! No! Morty, that's one of the most violently aggressive creature in the universe. He's my son! And if you hurt him, you have to kill me, Rick! Dad, I'm so confused. I know Morty Jr. I'm sorry. I ended up lying to you and yelling at you just like my parents did to me. You know parents are just kids having kids. One minute you like how a shiny robot looks, the next minute you're in a fist fight with your alien son. I'm an alien? We all have bad impulses, bad thoughts. We just have to learn to channel them into something constructive. But I want to murder everyone I see. Well you know, maybe there is a job out there for people that feel that way. Actually, there is. Hi, I'm Brad Anderson. Creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip "Marmaduke". You should consider being a creative. I'm hunted by uncontrollable thoughts of mutilation and sexual assaults on a nearly daily basis. But you know? I channeled it all into my work. I never got that impression from reading Marmaduke. Well, did you get the impression I was trying to make you laugh? Tell me that wasn't Brad Anderson. See, you hear that, Morty Jr.? Maybe you could try being a creative of some kind. Maybe? I always have sort of wanted to see my face on the back of a novel. I mean what I really wanna do is slit people's throat, but, beyond that. I know you can do it, son. I think it's time I get a place of my own. I promise I call you every day I need money or a place to do laundry. So, I assume this novel your son writes is gonna pay for my rear Axel? Isn't it interesting Summer, that after all that stuff we just did nothing really mattered, there was no point to it. Kind of makes you wonder, huh? About nothing Are you sure it doesn't make you re-evaluate your policy about taking girls on adventure? No I'd say given what we've been through, that I was right the whole time, and any epiphanies about gender politics were projection of your feminine insecurity. But hey, why don't you have pink spaceship? Go ride around, and have a jolly old time. Maybe that'll shut you up. Dad? Summer? Where were you guys this whole time? On Gazorpazorp. Where were you? I was reading a newspaper. Oh, that's interesting, Beth. You know it's funny... I heard about a little bit of news, myself. Take a look. Take a listen. This world... still got a... still got a chance! See you guys next week! See everybody next week! Mortimer Smith Jr. New York Times best selling author. Your book is about innocence, the definition of it, and inevitably its impossibility. Is it autobiographical? Certainly. I mean, all writing is, in my opinion. But, my... My father... kept me locked in the house until I was a teenager. And there was violence and... threats of poison gas. But also dancing. But you persevered and created this masterpiece from your suffering. Smith Jr.'s mind-bending novel, "My Horrible Father" in every store and on everyone's mind pick it up, we'll be right back. It's a thankless job, Morty. You did the best you could. I hope he's eating enough.Cynthia... Oh, my God! No, no... I told you! Hold on... Will you please... Not marry me? I choose Veronica. What? Yes! Called it. Why would he choose Veronica? Because he loves her. Well... if it's any consolation, Summer, none of it mattered, and the entire show is stupid. Okay, I've got an idea, Rick. You show us your concept of "good TV", and we'll crap all over that. I thought you'd never ask. Hey! Oh, cool! Is that crystallized Zanthonite? It conducts electrons across dimensions. Twenty percent accurate, as usual, Morty. The important thing being I just upgraded our cable package with programming from every conceivable reality. Wait, does that mean we get Showtime Extreme? How about Showtime Extreme in a world where man evolved from corn. We're not so different. We're both corn of action. Yeah. But one of us is... dead corn! Boring. Summer, you just spent three months, watching a man choose a fake wife. So what? It'd be better if the people were corn? Jerry, you don't get it. This is infinite TV, from infinite universes. Look. This sh1t is delicious. A movie about a guy eating sh1t. A violent Antiques Show... It's a pleasure to have you. The pleasure's all mine. Letterman from a time line where Jerry's famous... Wait! What in the hell? I agree. Where is this going? No, the other thing! Go back! Really? All right, fine. Glenn, this is a court order. It says you can't eat sh1t anymore. All right, Jerry, when you're right, you're right. Now I'm hooked. Rick and Morty S01E08 "Rixty Minutes" Coming up next on "Shmloo's the Shmloss", Shmlony has a nightmare. Shmlantha, Schmlona! Amazing. A dimension where all proper nouns begin with "Schmla". Schmlove, Schmlandula, Schmlonathan... All right, that got... that actually got old pretty quick. Rick, would you please go back to me on David Letterman? Infinity's a big number, Jerry. I don't remember the channel. Go back, go back! Jeez... You speak da tru-tru. Oh my God! Dad's in Cloud Atlas! I'm in Cloud Atlas! What's Cloud Atlas? Sometimes small tru-tru different than da big tru-tru. How is this possible? Infinite time lines, infinite possibilities. Including a time line where Jerry's a movie star. Look, you guys are getting excited about the wrong aspect of this device. Wa... Look at this. And now, another Quick Mystery. I just want to know who could've done something like this. It's a travesty! I did. See this knife and all the blood on it? Here's my fingerprints. Guilty! I sentence you to life in prison. Here's another Quick Mystery. My mother's dead! And I killed her. Here's the weapon. And cuff me, thank you very much. Guilty! Sentenced to murder. Here's another. I'm the killer! Wow, that one was really quick, wasn't it? Now who wants to watch random, crazy TV shows from different dimensions... and then who wants to narcissistically obsess about their alternate self? I want to obsess about myself. The narcisstic stuff. Here. These scan your retinas, and let you view parallel time lines through genetically matching versions of your eyes. Go fetch! Yes! This is so cool! Ladies First! I'm proud of you, Morty. Hey man, I don't give a crap about myself, Rick. Let's watch some crazy stuff, yo! I'm Ants-In-My-Eyes Johnson, Here at Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson's Electronics. I mean, there's so many ants in my eyes! And there's so many TVs, microwaves, radios... I think, I can't... I'm not 100% sure what we have here in stock, because I can't see anything. Our prices I hope aren't too low! Check out this refrigerator! Only $200! What about this microwave? Only $100! That's fair! I'm Ants-in-My-Eyes Johnson! Everything's black, I can't see a thing! And also I can't feel anything either, did I mention that? But that's not as catchy as having ants in your eyes. So that always goes, you know, off by the wayside. I can't feel. It's a very rare disease. All my... All my nerves, they don't allow for the sensation of touch. So I never know what's going on. Am I standing? Sitting? I don't know. Are we sure we want to do this? Look at our own alternate lives? You're right. Maybe we should just play Yahtzee. Give me those! What do you see? Whiteness. Pure whiteness. You're my best friend, Jerry Smith. I love doing cocaine with you. Whoa... I love doing cocaine with you too, Johnny Depp! Haven't we spent enough time on you? I'm performing surgery... but not on a horse, on a human! That's great, Beth! You always wanted to be a real surgeon. I am a real surgeon. Ahh... uh... Summer's turn! Finally! I don't see anything. Well, you should select a different timeline, I mean, if your father and I achieved our dreams, there's a chance you weren't even born. That came out wrong. That came out very wrong. Fine, I'll find a world where you bothered to have me. We're playing Yahtzee. Yahtzee's fun. We love Yahtzee. It's a fun game for fun families! Hey, could I get those goggles back for a second? It's a 45 horsepower with anti-lock brakes, and it's the official car of Mr. Sneezy 3D. It's the brand-new... Sneezy XL. The horn when you honk it makes a sneeze noise. It's polite, it's right, and it's Sneezy... Deezy... Mc... Deluxe. Oh, I'm Mr. Sneezy! Achoo! Huh, seems like TV from other dimensions has a somewhat looser feel to it. Yeah, it's got an almost improvisational tone. It's in theaters now! Coming this summer: Two brothers. In a van. And then a meteor hit. And they ran as fast as they could... from giant cat monsters. And then a giant tornado came... and that's when things got knocked into 12th gear. A Mexican armada shows up. With weapons made from to- ... tomatoes. And you better bet your bottom dollar... that these two brothers know how to handle business. In: Alien Invasion Tomato Monster Mexican Armada Brothers, Who Are Just Regular Brothers, Running In a van from an Asteroid... and All Sorts of Things... THE MOVIE! Hold on, there's more! Old women are coming, and they're also in the movie, and they're gonna come, and cross... attack... these two brothers. But let's get back to the brothers, because they're... they have a strong bond. You don't want to know about it here, but I'll tell you one thing: The moon... it comes crashing into Earth. And what do you do then? It's two brothers and... and th-they're... It's called... Two brothers... Two brothers! It's just called Two Brothers. Holy crap, I am winning a Nobel Prize. Come on! Time's up! I'm taming a lion! No, wait, uh... there are film cameras. I might be a lion-tamer in a movie. You get the idea. I work with lions. Ooh, we're not playing Yahtzee, we're playing Chutes and Ladders. It seems like when I exist, life gets a little more, I don't know... predictable? When two people create a life together, they set aside their previous lives as individuals. Gimme a break! We're not heroes for having unprotected s*x on prom night. Oh, I get it. Now that you know you could have had it better, you resent me for holding you back. Now that we know you think the tables are turning, we know you thought there were unturned tables! What are you talking about? All this time, you've been thinking, "What if that loser Jerry hadn't talked me out of the abortion?" Well now you know, you'd be a doctor. Whoop-dee-doo. You'd also be drinking wine, alone in a house full of exotic birds. And I'd be on DiCaprio's yacht, banging Kristen Stewart! You thought about getting an abortion? Everyone thinks about it. Obviously, I'm the version of me that didn't do it. So... you're welcome. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah, thank you guys so much. It's a real treat to be raised by parents that force themselves to be together instead of being happy. Hey, do we have any wafer cookies? Oh, boy. Looks like you guys have been checking out alternate lives and realizing you don't have it as good, huh? That's too bad. You know, me and Morty are having a blast, We just discovered a show called "Ball Fondlers". I mean, I don't want to rub it in or anything, but you guys clearly backed the wrong conceptual horse. I'm in heaven right now. This might be the best day of my life. So now what do we do? That show "Ball Fondlers" sounded kind of interesting. Dad! What? They're having fun in there! What do you guys want from me? Every family on this block has to wonder if they're together by choice. Our family just has inter-dimensional goggles to show us for a fact that we're not. We'll I'm leaving! You can't leave, you're 17! Yeah, and I'm not pregnant. I'm gonna have better judgment than you guys had at my age. I'm gonna... move to the southwest and... I don't know, do something with turquoise. It's Saturday Night Live! Starring... a piece of toast! Two guys, with handle-bar mustaches! A man painted silver who makes robot noises! Gar Manarnar! Three... uh... uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to that one... A hole in the wall, where the men can see it all... and returning, for his 25th consecutive year: Bobby Moynihan! Interesting fun fact, uh, Moynihan and piece of toast hate each other. Apparently they've got some real creative differences.

Don't even worry about it... I hate Mumunmunundsdays. And I really could go for some enchiladas. Hey Rick, that's pretty cool! It's just like Garfield, only instead, it's Gazorpazorpfield. Hey, isn't Gazorpazorp where uh... where those s*x robots came from, remember? That whole thing? Yeah... hey, that's pretty, pretty... that's true. That's right! Yeah. Let's watch some more Gazorpazorpfield! Hey Jon, it's me, Gazorpazorpfield. Boy. [BLEEP] you, Jon. You [BLEEP] dumb, stupid, idiot. Come on, Gazorpazorpfield, go easy on me, huh? You dumb, stupid, weak, pathetic, white, white... uh, uh... guilt, white guilt, milquetoast piece of human garbage. Jeez, Gazorpazorpfield, thats, you know... you're pretty mean to me, but that takes the cake. I don't give a [BLEEP]! I'm Gazorpazorp-[BLEEP]-field, bitch! Now give me my [BLEEP] enchiladas! Hey, Rick, you know, did they use Bill Murray for this? Sounds a lot like Bill Murray. No, Morty, it's Lorenzo Music. In this reality, he's still alive. Oh, okay, was his name Lorenzo Music? Yeah, I'm pretty sure. He also did that voice of that one guy from Ghostbusters. Which is really strange, because it's the same character Bill Murray played in the movie. But then, when they made the movie... Bill Murray did the voice of Gazorpazorp... or Garfield, I mean. Yeah, that's pretty cool, Rick. So all that happened in this reality too? I don't know. Just making conversation with you, Morty. What do you think? I-I-I-I know everything about everything? Did you really talk me out of the abortion? Well, we... we blew a tire on the way to the clinic. I think, in my head, I was doing it all for the kids. And now the first kid is going to do something with turquoise. What is either code for crystal meth, or a gateway to it. So we didn't do the kids any favors. So, we should stay together for each other and ourselves, or... Or? Man. Woman. And now trunk men? We know science has created men that have a trunk that allows them to have s*x with both male and female partners. But we don't like the idea of these people getting married. Put a line in the sand everybody--, people! Vote no on proposition XW2. The act that says that gay... uh... trunk people can get married. Who needs it? Not on my watch! Paid for by Michael Dennys and The Denny Singers. Hi, I'm a trunk person. And I want... I-I feel love in my heart, too, just like you. I want to be able to express that love, with both a man and a woman. And I won't be able to... If Denny and The Denny Singers get their way. Hey, let the trunk people have s*x and get married, huh? Paid for by... Trunk People. Oh, I love me Strawberry Smiggles! Ooh, I hope nobody ever gets my hands on me, and tries to steal my Strawberry Smiggles. I'm going to eat every last one of them, because... and then they'll be in my stomach, and nobody will ever be able to eat them. Except for me, because they're going to be all inside my stomach. I'm... my name is Mister... Top Hat Jones, and God forbid anyone ever take my sniggy, little pig-dul... smiggles. I'm keeping 'em all for me. Last bite. Oh, now they are all resting comfortably in my stomach. Ooh, am I feeling good. No! Get away from me! Get away from me and my Strawberry Smiggles! No! Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ! It hurts! My entrails are out! Why would you even want to eat these? They're soaked with my stomach acid! Oh, Jesus Christ! Lord and savior and spirit! Save me! Take me to the light! Oh, my God, I see Demons! I see demons are coming! Jeez, Rick. Oh my god! That's some pretty hardcore stuff, you know, for a cereal commercial. Well, you know, Morty, I mean, you want to sell boxes of cereal, you gotta, you gotta, pump the gas a little. Pedal to the metal, Morty. In a world, where muscular mannies, are coming, and they're coming strong, there's only three... unmuscular... Michaels. Get down! Hurry, run! And that's when real turbulent juice is coming, and you gotta take care of it. With turbulent juice, Turmulent tables. No room is safe from the turbulent power of turbulent juice. What in the hell? s*x sells, Morty. s*x sells what? Was that a movie, or like, does it clean stuff? Hey, Dad. W-w-what's going on? Oh, your mother and I are going to be spending some time apart, Morty. And your sister found out she was an unwanted pregnancy. W-w-w-what? Speaking of "w-w-what", Morty... W-w-what should we watch next? What about this? Baby Legs, you're a good detective... but not good enough, because of your baby legs. So I'm partnering you up with Regular Legs. Hey there. Detective, I'm... this is upsetting to me, because I feel like I don't need no regular-leg partner. Baby Legs, don't talk back to me. Good luck you two, there's a criminal to kill. Wow, you sure found this guy quick! Uh, yeah, because I'm a good detective. Look, Baby Legs, it's the criminal! [BLEEP], I'm the killer. I'm running, running real quick... Baby Legs, here we go! That's the sound I make, when I'm trying to run fast. All right, I'm not going to get him. I'm, I-I just learned a real valuable lesson. I'm coming, Baby Legs! I'm... Regular Legs! We got him! Hey, that was good team work. Baby Legs, and Regular Legs, I'm proud of you two for working together, and Baby Legs, I know it was hard for you to come to the conclusion that you need a partner. But I'm proud of you that you did it. Hey thanks, chief! Now get the [BLEEP] out of here! Pretty cool, huh, Morty? Oh. Uh, I thought it was cool. I don't give a [BLEEP] what you think, Jerry. Hey, uh... Y-Y-Y-You doin' okay? I-I-I kind of know how you feel, Summer. No, you don't. You're the little brother. You're not the cause of your parents' misery. You're just a symptom of it. Can I show you something? Morty, no offense, but a drawing of me you made when you were 8 isn't gonna make make me feel like less of an accident. That, out there? That's my grave. Wait, what? On one of our adventures, Rick and I basically destroyed the whole world. So we bailed on that reality, and we came to this one. Because in this one, the world wasn't destroyed. And in this one, we were dead. So we came here, a-a-and we buried ourselves, and we took their place. And every morning, Summer, I eat breakfast, 20 yards away from my own rotting corpse. So, you're not my brother? I'm better than your brother. I'm a version of your brother you can trust when he says, "Don't run". Nobody exists on purpose, nobody belongs anywhere... everybody's gonna die. Come watch TV. Mrs. Sullivan always planned to leave everything to her cats. But sometimes, plans need a helping paw. What are the kitties to do, but buckle together and work as a team. Mrs. Sullivan, I, uh... please forgive me for being forward. But your eyes are so beautiful! Wait, this is an actual movie? This fall... sparks will fly! Mrs... Oh... Sullivan... Between one guy, who can't get a break... There's something about you, Mrs. Sullivan. ...and 9 cats who break all the rules. Last Will and Testa-meow: Weekend at Dead Cat Lady's House 2. Well, somebody in Hollywood just lost their job. Written and directed by Jerry Smith. I wrote and directed that? What am I, nuts? Hey Morty, you just missed a preview for your Dad's "Citizen Kane". Doesn't matter. Hey, if your, uh, mother and I had to split custody... who would you guys choose? Doesn't matter. Breaking News: Academy Award-winning actor Jerry Smith is leading police on a slow-speed pursuit after suffering an apparent breakdown. Don't even think about it. Come on, Jer- Are you kidding me, Jerry? It's just a bunch of dumb tabloid crap. It's my life, and we're watching it. You did it, Beth. You really nailed it. You're a surgeon. A human surgeon. Yay... you win. Where the hell am I going? What are you asking me for Jerry? I'm sitting here trying to figure out why the cops don't just take you out. They got a clear shot to your head. I can't believe our tax dollars pay for this. Jerry? Jerry Smith? Beth Sanchez, I have been in love with you since high school. I hate acting, I hate cocaine, I hate Kristen Stewart. I wish you hadn't gotten that abortion, and I never stopped thinking about what might've been. Hey, Ball Fondlers? Huh? Ball Fondlers? Yeah, I could go for some Ball Fondlers. Yeah, Ball Fondlers. Ha-ha, Hamster-in-Butt-World Weather is done, and now it's sports time, coming up. Oh, hello there! Good day to you, Miss. So the hamsters live inside the rectums of those people? Yeah, sweetie, that's where they live. Well, how does that work? I mean, do the butts look like little apartments inside? Yeah! And can they like, leave the butt, and walk around on their own? Look, I don't know! I'm watching the same thing you guys are. Grandpa Rick, if they leave the butt, and the person wanders off... How would they find their butt person again? I don't know, Summer! I can't even hear the TV! All right, that's it. We're just gonna go there, so you idiots can ask your stupid questions all day. Ooh! Family vacation!Hey, Rick. I have to make a project for the science fair this weekend. You think you could help me out? Whatever. Well, I mean, traditionally, science fairs are a father-son thing. Well, scientifically, traditions are an idiot thing. Morty, I think it would be fun for you to work on a science project with your dad. Uh... Yeah, dad. Why don't we do it together? Yes! You backed the right horse on this one, son. We'll get out the crayons, brew some coffee, and knock this thing out in two or three days. What is my purpose? Pass the butter. Thank you. Dad, I need a ride to work. Maybe Rick can give you a ride. I'm helping Morty with science. I'm busy. Doing what? Uh, anything else. What is my purpose? You pass butter. Oh, my god. Yeah, welcome to the club, pal. Since when do you have a job? Since last week. It's part-time at this little vintage thrift store. My boss is this really smart, eccentric old man that treats me nice and values me. Meow. Can't wait to meet this fascinating character. Please don't. Oh. Well, when did this stop being Jamba Juice? I've just recently opened for business, mister, um, Goldenfold. You know my name? That's disarming. I also know you long for female company. You know, it has been lonely since the divorce. Some voids can't be filled with Jamba Juice. This aftershave makes a man quite irresistible to women. Free of charge. One never pays here-- not with money. Nothing to read into there. Thanks! Sorry I'm late, mr. Needful. This is my grandpa, Rick. He was just leaving. Huh. Tell me, Rick, what do you desire? Eh, I make my own stuff. So, what are you-- like, the devil? What? Sorry? I don't know. Store comes out of nowhere, all the sh1t's old and creepy. Are you the devil? A demon? Leprechaun? Grandpa Rick! Hey, I'm not judging. Just like shoot straight. I'm a man of science. Ah, then perhaps you could make use of this. This microscope reveals things beyond comprehension. Grandpa, go home and drink. Why don't we do a model of the solar system? That's what my dad did with me when I was your age. Oh, okay. You know, Rick's in his lab, making cyborgs and wormholes and all that weird stuff, but this is real science. A man and his boy, making planets. Hey, how about we use a ping-pong ball for Pluto? And then Jupiter -- Uh, actually, I don't think Pluto's a planet. Of course Pluto's a planet, son. I learned that in the third grade. Well, yeah, but you know they changed it. Morty, nobody changed the planets. I just googled it. Pluto's not a planet. They changed it in 2006. Yeah, I heard about that, Morty. And I disagree. You disagree? That's right. It's possible to disagree in science, Morty. Pluto was a planet. Some committee of fancy assholes disagree. I disagree back. Give me a ping-pong ball. Um, okay. I-I just have to... Go find Rick and go over my head about Pluto? No. Geez, I just got to go to the bathroom. Damn. Oh. Okay, good. This is gonna be fun. Hey, Morty, let me ask you a question real quick. Does evil exist, and if so, can one detect and measure it? Um... Rhetorical question, Morty. The answer's "yes, you just have to be a genius". Cute. Your sister's boss gave me a microscope that would have made me retarded. Ooh. Oh, boy, Rick. I'm don't think you're allowed to say that word, you know? Morty, I'm not disparaging the differently abled. I'm stating the fact that if I had used this microscope, it would have made me mentally retarded. Okay, yeah, but I don't think it's about logic, Rick. I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing. Well, that's retarded. What are you guys talking about? Apparently, nothing. You asked him if Pluto's a planet, didn't you? No! It's not. Shut up, Rick. Whoa. I don't care what anyone says. If it can be a planet, it can be a planet again. Planet. Planet, planet, planet. Stay scientific, Jerry. This aftershave made women want me, but it also made me impotent! A price for everything, mr. Goldenfold. A price for everything. Oh, my God! How could I not see this coming?! My lust! My greed! I deserved this! I deserved this! This serum should counteract the negative effects. Holy cats! Ladies, let's get out of here. I haven't learned a thing! Here. You can have this back. You didn't use it? Sure I did -- to develop this. It detects and catalogs all your "twilight zone", "ray bradbury", "Friday the 13th" the series voodoo crap magic. I thought you might want it so you didn't accidentally sell anybody, say... A typewriter that generates best-selling murder mysteries and then makes the murders happen in real life? Ooh. Be quiet. Don't you want to make sure people know what they're getting? You're not intentionally selling... beauty cream that makes ugly ladies pretty but also makes them blind? I find this all quite preposterous. Oh, I say, good sir. Oh, harrumph. Oh, oh Oh, oh that's beautiful. You know it's gonna be wearing you in three hours? Do I need to call the police? Here, you can use my phone. Don't worry. It won't make you deaf because I'm not a hack. You think you're so great, you stupid piece of sh1t. Stop! Hey! [Beep] you, man. Stop it right now! Grandpa Rick, I like working here. You work for the devil. So what? "So what?" Yes, so what if he's the devil, Rick? At least the devil has a job. At least he's active in the community. What do you do? You eat our food and make gadgets. Buh-bye. Whoops. I'm sorry, mr. Needful. I'll clean that up. I don't know what I can do about the ghost lady that came out of it, but -- It's fine. Summer, you know, your grandfather's right. This store curses people. That's my business. Well, yeah. Fast-food gives people diabetes, and clothing stores have sweatshops. Is there a company hiring teenagers that isn't evil? This is my first job. You've been nice to me, mr. Needful. You respect me. Please, call me "the devil". I'd rather not, actually. Yes, perhaps not during business hours. I told you, I want to file a declaration that Pluto is a planet. Well, then my son's going to fail his science class, and when that happens, I'm suing you first. I think I know what the "a" in NASA stands for. Dad, what's your endgame? Ain't no game, sucka. Why don't we just make the solar system with eight planets? It's even easier. Sure, sure, and why don't we just burn Galileo at the stake for saying the sun is round? Science isn't always easy, Morty. Whoa! Whoa! What the hell?! I'm king Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto. We discovered you quite by accident during routine surveillance of your world. You really gave it to those guys at NASA. I was -- you know, sometimes science is about conviction. I'd like to introduce you to a few people that very much agree with you. Oh, I... Plutonians. Jerry Smith is a scientist from earth, where he's creating a model of our solar system. Jerry, tell Pluto about your decision. Um... Pluto's a planet. Pluto's a [beep] planet, bitch! Oh, man. This is definitely gonna go to his head. If it's athletic prowess you desire, principle v*g1n*, I might -- I'll take it. But I haven't even -- Thank you very, very much. Great store. Great place. Bye. Huh. Okay. I must say, summer, I thought your grandfather's outburst would have disrupted business, but this is the best weekend I've had since salem. Nice. "Wholesome delight" for lunch? Is that the vegan place? Yeah, I love their soup. I'm kind of soup-ed out. Mrs. Tate, is it? What do you desire? Whoa, whoa, slow down, honey. Oh, is there a limit? Everything's free, right? Let's just say you don't pay... with money. That was perfect. You pay with the curses, right? Um... I -- well... But, mrs. Tate, why do you want cursed items? Well, I'm going to get the curses removed at "Curse Purge Plus". You know, the guy on TV? What? Have you acquired creepy specific old stuff from a mysterious antique or thrift store that gives you powers but [beep] with you in unforeseeable ways? Bring it to "Curse Purge Plus". I use science to un-curse the items for cash, and you get to keep the powers. This guy got mysterious sneakers to make him run faster, but guess what? He would have had to run until he died, making them worthless. I removed the curse, making them worth, like, I don't know, $8 million. See you at the olympics. This eerily intelligent doll was threatening to murder its family. Now it does their taxes. Everything's deductible. Don't pay for cool stuff with your soul. Pay for it with money. You know, like how every other store in the world works? We're located at First and Main in old town. Come on -- come on down. "First and..." That's right across the street from "Needful Things," where you can get evil items for free! Diabolic son of a motherf-- We're back on "Good morning, Pluto." And a very good morning it is for our guest, earth scientist Jerry Smith, who's making headlines with his bold announcement that is what, Jerry? Pluto is a planet. Well, how about that. I love it. Morty Smith. I'm Scroopy Noopers. I'm a scientist. Can I show you something? Uh, I better not. Right now. The center of Pluto, mr. Smith, is made of a substance called "Plutonium". Mines like these suck Plutonium up to the cities, where corporations use it to power everything, from diamond cars to golden showers. And the more we remove, the more Pluto shrinks. There it goes again. Just shrank a little. But a few years ago, your scientists noticed Pluto had gotten so small they couldn't even call it a "planet" anymore. Should've been our wake-up call. But the rich Plutonians won't wake up, and they love your dad telling everyone Pluto's a planet because that means they can keep mining until Pluto goes from planet to asteroid to meteor, and finally... Um, a party? Is everyone in your family an idiot? Well, for sure me and my dad are. Well, all you have to do is get him to admit that, and you could save four billion lives. Yeah, you know, the thing is my dad's really insecure. Hmm. Funny. Mr. Needful, out of everything in the store, you'll never guess what we couldn't get rid of. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. I wish this desk was lighter. I wish this knot was looser. Come on. I don't -- Wait, what am I doing? I wish I knew CPR. 1, 2, 3. Oh, Jesus. What a waste of a monkey paw. Mr. Needful, how could you even think of doing something so horrible? I'm the devil. What should I do when I fail -- get myself an ice cream? You haven't failed. People like Rick are making me obsolete. I mean, seriously. I may be "the devil", but your grandpa is the devil. I just want to go back to hell, where everyone thinks I'm smart and funny. No! It's not fair. Everyone in this town got something they wanted from you -- even Rick. I was your only friend, and I get nothing? Okay. I'll give you one thing. Name it. I want to help you. Clever twist. I learned from the best, you old fart. Now, let's go get you hydrated. Looks like we've got... haunted boxing gloves that will make you the heavyweight champion in 1936, and then you'll be trapped there, winning the same fight for eternity. I can take out the "eternity" and the padding, and then you'll have some time-traveling mittens. Oh, look, it's Rosemary's baby. How's business? Here's the last of our inventory. We're going to file chapter 11 and do some restructuring. Sounds like code for "you win, Rick." That was important to you, wasn't it? Nope. It was important to your dumb devil friend. To me, this was all just a bit, like when bugs bunny [beep] with the opera singer for 20 minutes. He tried to kill himself. Seriously? Holy crap. Holy crap. But you know what, grandpa Rick? He's strong, and he's never going to give up. Uh-huh, yeah, I don't care. Oh, I know. Everyone knows you don't care. So? So have fun not caring. I always do. Good. Yeah, it is good. It's the best. I'm sure it is. Bye. Later. I'm here to pick up my undead cat and child. Yeah, uh... Give me a sec. These are the forms for the employee health plan. All right, yeah, put -- put them on my... Eh. I just got bored. Everybody out. All right, just one more rally, then I promise we'll get back to your science project. Dad, Pluto isn't a planet. It's shrinking because of corporations. Yeah, that's what that anti-planet nut job Scroopy Noopers was screaming about outside the ministry of money's fundraiser. Are you telling me four billion Plutonians are wrong? You said science wasn't easy. I said science isn't always easy. Obviously, that means sometimes it is easy. Let's not debase ourselves with word games, son. Dad, their whole planet is dying. Ha! You called it a planet. Checkmate. What's up, Pluto? Mr. Smith, please tell my friend here what you just told me. Go on. My very eager mother just served us nine pickles, and the "pickles" is Pluto. My god, the man's a genius. Um, excuse me. Morty, what? Dad, what did you think about the recent report published by the Pluto science reader linking Pluto-quakes, sinkholes, and surface shrinkage to deep-core Plutonium drilling? Well, son, what did you think when you were 5 and you pooped your pants, and you threw your poopy undies out your bedroom window because you thought it was like throwing something in the garbage? I mean, I'm trimming the hedges, and these things are just hanging there. Was I supposed to think the poop bunny left them? Good one, dad. Hey, Morty, you want to go on a... Oh. Hey, Beth. Hello? Hey, Jerry, you in here being stupid? Thanks. Hey, you know, I was thinking, you know, I might watch a movie. I am not programmed for friendship. Suit yourself. Hey. Hey. W-w-what's going on? Um, listen, can you help me do the stupid science fair project? Whatever. Jerry, you must be so excited. The Pluto-bel prize is the highest honor a scientist can receive. I'm flattered and humbled. Oh, I like that. Use that in your speech. Also, talk about Pluto being a planet. People like that. Your highness, we've captured Scroopy Noopers. You animals! Animals! Ooh, look who's little journey's come to an end. Take him to Pluto-namo bay. You can't kill the truth, father. What? I can see you're confused. Pluto-namo bay is a military prison-- a sort of play on words. Did he call you "father"? Scroopy Noopers, the anti-planet nut job, is your son? The young eat the old if you let them, Jerry. Pluto is a cold, cold celestial dwarf. It's a what? Huh? Oh, planet. "Pluto is a cold, cold planet". That's what I meant. Knock them dead out there, you. Pluto is... Not a planet. Ow! It's not a planet. Hey! It's not a planet! I'm an idiot, and I love my son. It was a long six hours, but we've overhauled "Needful Things" into the globally-compliant web 4.0, "e-nomenon", "n33dful.com", spelled with threes instead of "e"'s. Whoo, yeah! Whoo, excited! Okay, that's it. We just got bought by Google! Mm. I'm so proud of you, Lucius. So, how much did we make? "We". This is my business. Security! You're Zuckerberg-ing me? I was Zuckerberg-ing people before Zuckerberg's balls dropped. I'm the devil, bitch! What, what?! Hey! Hey! Hey, Morty. Oh, oh, hey, dad. Um, what -- what are you doing back from Pluto so quick? Uh... Some people just can't handle the truth. Especially dummies like me. Morty, I'm not as smart as your grandpa Rick, but I promise never to make that your problem again. Hey, dad. Nobody's smarter than Rick, but nobody else is my dad. You're a genius at that. Wow. That's... humbling and flattering, son. Thank you. What say we finish ourselves an eight-planet solar system? Um... I'm just gonna take this thing in and get an "A". Butter. But... You're a genius at being my dad, dad. Quit while you're ahead. And also, knock next time, you know? I mean, I'm sitting in here, I'm 14 -- I got a computer in here, you know? Oh, I -- I think I understand. You're really playing with fire when you burst in here like that, man. I get it. Say no more. I mean, one of these days, you know, you're gonna end up seeing something. I got it! Noted. Good night. How's your pretend grandpa doing, aka "the devil"? He dumped me. Oof. Sorry. Did we learn a lesson here I'm not seeing? Not sure. Maybe in a much bigger way, mr. Needful gave us both what we really wanted? Because I was always jealous of you hanging out with Morty, and you didn't realize how much you valued my approval? No, that's dumb. Yeah, not satisfying. I'll tell you what, though. If -- if -- if it's satisfaction you're after, I think I might have an idea. Uh-huh. Uh-huh, totally.
