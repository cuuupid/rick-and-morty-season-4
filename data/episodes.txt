RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT. MORTY’S HOME - DAY
JERRY is on the sofa watching TV. SUMMER is next to him,
texting. Snuffles, the family dog, walks up and looks at
Jerry.
JERRY
(to Snuffles)
What?
(no response)
Why are you looking at me?
(no response)
You want to go outside?
(no response)
Outside?
Jerry gets up, crosses the room and opens the back door. The
dog watches him.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Outside?
No response. Jerry closes the door, crosses back to the sofa
and sits down.
Snuffles raises a leg and pisses on the floor.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Are you KIDDING me?! Come ON!
SUMMER
(still texting)
Oh my God I’m going to die.
Morty runs in.
MORTY
What’s wrong?
JERRY
Your idiot dog!
MORTY
Oh, he didn’t mean it! Did you
Snuffles? You didn’t mean it,
you’re a good boy! Good dog!
JERRY
Don’t praise him now, Morty! He
just pissed on the carpet!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 1.
Jerry shoves the dog’s face into the carpet.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Bad dog. Bad!
Rick walks in, grabs Morty’s arm, and starts dragging him
away.
RICK
Morty, come on. I need your help
tonight.
JERRY
Wait, hold on a second, Rick... You
wouldn’t, by any chance, have some
crazy science thing you could whip
up that might help make this dog
easier to house train would you?
RICK
I thought the whole point of having
a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.
If I were you, I wouldn’t pull that
thread.
(To Morty)
Come on, Morty.
Jerry grabs Morty’s other arm, playing tug of war with Rick.
JERRY
Listen, Rick! If you’re gonna stay
here rent free and use my son for
your stupid science, the least you
could do is put a little bit of it
to use for the family! You make
that dog smart or Morty’s grounded!
MORTY †
Awww, man! †
SUMMER
Haha awesome.
Rick drops Morty’s arm.
RICK
You’ve really got me up against a
wall here, Jerry.
He exits the room. We hear some scientific work from the
garage. Rick comes back in with a helmet device with all
kinds of wires and doo-dads sticking out of it.
He sticks it on the dog’s head and turns it on. Summer puts
her phone down and watches.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 2.
RICK (CONT’D)
Ruffles --
(to Jerry)
What’s his name?
MORTY
Snuffles.
RICK
Snuffles. Shake.
Snuffles sits up and shakes.
RICK (CONT’D)
Roll over.
Snuffles rolls over.
RICK (CONT’D)
Go to the bathroom.
Snuffles walks away.
We wait a beat and hear the toilet flush. Snuffles returns.
JERRY
Holy crap!
SUMMER †
No way! †
RICK (CONT’D)
Yeah, you’re at the top of your
game, now, Jerry. Have fun.
(To Morty)
Come on, Morty.
Rick grabs Morty’s arm and drags him out of the room. Summer
and Jerry rush over to the Dog.
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty enter.
MORTY
That was fantastic, Rick!
RICK
If you like that, Morty, you’re
gonna love this.
Rick turns his head to reveal a SMALL DEVICE sticking out of
his ear. It looks like a high tech blue tooth ear piece.
MORTY
What is it?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 3.
RICK
It’s a device that will allow us to
enter people’s dreams, Morty. Just
like in that movie you never shut
the fuck up about.
MORTY
Inception?
RICK
That’s right. This is gonna be
like that except it’s gonna make
sense.
MORTY
Inception made sense...
RICK
You don’t have to try to impress
me, Morty. Tonight we’re going to
the home of your math teacher,
Mister Goldenfold, and we’re going
to use this bad boy to enter his
dreams and convince him to give you
less homework. That way, you’ll
have more time to help me with my
science.
MORTY
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you
to make this, couldn’t you have
just helped me with my homework?
RICK
Are you listening, Morty? Homework
is stupid, the whole point is to
get less of it. Not very bright,
are you? No wonder you’re doing
bad in school. Now let’s get over
to your teacher’s house and make
with some incepting.
INT. GOLDENFOLD’S LIVING ROOM - DUSK
Mr. Goldenfold lies on his couch. ON TV we see Jada Pinkett
having a very serious conversation with a HANDSOME BLACK MAN.
JADA PINKET
You don’t know me.
HANDSOME BLACK MAN
Then let me get to know you, damn
it!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 4.
Goldenfold is snacking on a box of WHEAT THINS.
GOLDENFOLD
(sleepy)
Not today, Darius. Not today.
He passes out and starts to snore. Rick and Morty climb in
through the window with the dream inceptors. Rick puts a
device in Goldenfold’s ear and two similar ones in his and
Morty’s ears. Rick notices the TV. Jada Pinkett is making
out with the handsome black man.
RICK
Uh oh. Spoilers!
Rick quickly turns the TV off.
RICK (CONT’D)
I’m a full season behind on Jada
Pinkett’s You Don’t Know Me.
MORTY
I can’t believe I’m in Mr.
Goldenfold’s house. This is so
weird.
RICK
It’s about to get a whole lot
weirder, Morty.
He turns a dial on Morty’s bluetooth, Morty falls asleep in
an awkward heap on the floor. Rick positions himself next to
Goldenfold on the couch and turns his own bluetooth dial,
falling asleep in comfort.
INT. AIRPLANE (GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM) - CONTINUOUS
Jada Pinkett is a sexy stewardess walking down the aisle
handing out Wheat Thins to PASSENGERS.
JADA PINKET
Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins.
GOLDENFOLD
I’ll take two.
JADA PINKET
(flirty)
I think you’ve had enough, sir.
GOLDENFOLD
You don’t know me.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 5.
They laugh flirtatiously with each other. ANGLE ON Rick and
Morty, a few rows back.
RICK
Alright, Morty, time to make our
move.
Rick grabs some bottles and napkins from the nearby drink
cart, and hands one to Morty.
RICK (CONT’D)
Wrap this around your head. We’re
about to take Goldenfold’s
subconscious hostage.
MOMENTS LATER
Jada Pinkett is sitting on Goldenfold’s lap, feeding him
Wheat Thins and giggling. Rick and Morty pop up dressed as
terrorists. Morty has a woman’s shawl wrapped around his
head like a hajib. Rick rips his coat open to reveal a fake
suicide vest made of soda bottles.
RICK (CONT’D)
Allah (buuurrrrp) Akbar! We’re
taking control of this plane!
We’re gonna 9/11 it unless Morty
Smith gets better grades in math.
The passengers start to freak out. Jada Pinkett sees
Goldenfold making a move.
JADA PINKET
Don’t be a hero, sir.
GOLDENFOLD
Miss Pinkett? I don’t know what
else to be.
Goldenfold takes a handful of Wheat Thins and holds them like
throwing stars.
RICK
I said nobody move, buddy!
GOLDENFOLD
The name’s not Buddy. It’s
Goldenfold. Nice to Wheat You!
He throws the thins like ninja stars at Rick & Morty’s faces.
While they’re distracted, he pulls two machine guns from the
drink cart.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 6.
RICK
Take cover, Morty!
Rick and Morty take cover as Goldenfold lights up the plane
with gunfire.
GOLDENFOLD
Always bet on black!
(reloads)
And invest in gold...
RICK
Bit of a snag, Morty. Goldenfold’s
got more control here than I
anticipated.
Rick waits for a burst of automatic gunfire to stop
interrupting him.
RICK (CONT’D)
I mean, the guy teaches high school
math, I didn’t take him for an
active dreamer.
(waits out gunfire)
We gotta take him out so he wakes
up. But we can’t get killed,
Morty, if you get killed in someone
else’s dream, you die for real.
MORTY
What?! Aww, man!
RICK
Don’t be a baby! You avoid getting
shot in real life all the time,
just do the same thing here and
you’ll be fine!
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER
Beth stands in her work scrubs with folded arms as Jerry and
Summer show off the smart dog. Summer is filming it all with
her phone.
JERRY
Now bring me my slippers.
Snuffles brings them.
SUMMER
Now, be my foot stool, Snuffles!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 7.
Snuffles stands under Summer’s legs. She rests them on
Snuffles. Summer and Jerry turn to Beth.
JERRY
Now this is what I’m talking about.
This is a dog. Man’s best friend,
working to make his master happy!
BETH
I don’t know, Jerry... I’m kind of
disturbed by this to be honest...
JERRY
What? Come on, Beth!
SUMMER
Yeah, mom, why are you trying to
rain on our parade?
BETH
Look, it’s fine. Have a ball. I’m
just saying, it feels creepy to me.
Beth leaves the room. Snuffles makes a moaning sound like
“Mishka the Talking Dog” from Youtube.
SNUFFLES
Ruoah Ruoah!
SUMMER
Oh my God, he’s trying to tell us
something. That is so awesome.
Snuffles starts trying to “talk” some more.
SNUFFLES
Ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah!
Snuffles is visibly frustrated by his limited speech
capabilities.
JERRY
He’s saying he loves lasagna!
Snuffles shakes his head “no” and waves his hands. It’s like
a game of charades and he’s losing. He is very frustrated.
(Look to the dog from Wallace and Grommet for some great dog
character acting cues.)
SNUFFLES
Ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah!!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 8.
SUMMER
(excited)
He’s saying “I love Obama!” So
cute! I’m posting this online,
like, right now.
Summer darts out. Jerry pats Snuffles on the head and exits.
Snuffles, now alone, sighs. He walks up to a mirror and
looks at himself and the cognition amplifying helmet he
wears. He paws at a compartment on it. It flips open
revealing two AA batteries. He stares at them for awhile and
then walks out of the room.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Snuffles walks up to the JUNK DRAWER and noses it open. It’s
filled with batteries, extension cords, and the like. He
stares at it all and cocks his head.
EXT. AIRPLANE (GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM) - DAY
Goldenfold finishes another sustained burst of machine gun
fire.
RICK (O.S.)
Goldenfold! We’re coming out, we
just want to talk!
GOLDENFOLD
Why would I negotiate with you?
RICK
Because we’re both rational adults
who don’t want any thing bad to
happen.
Rick emerges from his cover, using Jada Pinkett as a human
shield.
RICK (CONT’D)
And because I have a human shield.
GOLDENFOLD
JADA!!!
Goldenfold panics. As a result, the other dream passengers
panic too. They get out of their seats and run around the
plane, screaming.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 9.
RICK
Uh oh! His subconscious is
panicking!
A passenger opens the emergency exit door. A tremendous
suction takes several passengers, along with Rick, Morty and
Jada Pinkett, out the door.
EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS
Rick, Morty, and Jada Pinkett are in a free fall.
MORTY
Ooooooohhhhhh!!! Rick, what are we
going to do!?
RICK
Be quiet, Morty! Every second I’m
answering your questions is a
second I’m not coming up with a
plan --
A Skymall magazine flies into Rick’s face. He pulls it off
and looks at it.
RICK (CONT’D)
Whoa. Look at this, Morty. A wifi
controlled hot dog cooker.
Pretty interesting.
END ACT ONE
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 10.
ACT TWO
EXT. SKY (GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM) - DAY
Rick and Morty are free falling. Jada Pinkett is falling next
to them.
MORTY
Ahhh!! Nooooo!!
RICK
Relax! Look Morty! Jada Pinkett
has a parachute! Come on!
They move towards her in free fall and grab on. Rick reaches
around and pulls the cord. The parachute opens. They float
down at a much slower pace.
JADA PINKET
Hey! You better watch yourself!
MORTY
Rick, look!
Down below they see that Goldenfold has landed the plane.
He’s constructing a complicated trap for Rick and Morty to
fall into when they land, and another device built to save
Jada from the complicated trap.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Oh no, Rick! Look! Goldenfold
landed the plane and now he’s
creating a massive lava pit for us
to fall into, but it looks like he
has a mechanical claw arm he plans
to use to save Jada Pinket! But he
definitely won’t save us, Rick!
What are we going to do?!
RICK
Oh, boy. Looks like we’ve merely
prolonged the inevitable.
(realizing)
That’s it! Prolong the inevitable!
Listen, Morty, if we can go into
Jada Pinkett’s dream, everything
will go a hundred times slower.
We’ll have plenty of time to incept
Jada into leveraging Goldenfold to
our benefit.
JADA PINKET
You don’t know me!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 11.
Rick bonks her on the head, knocking her unconscious. He and
Morty both struggle against the wind to reach the sleep dials
on their bluetooths. They’re a few hundred yards away from
falling into an active volcanoEXT.
MAGICAL CASTLE - TWO DREAMS DEEP - DAY
Rick and Morty land in bushes in front of a crystal palace
amidst a fantasy world setting.
MORTY
Ohh... This is just like my
favorite fantasy series “Age of
Andurius!”
RICK
Nerd alert.
A pair of CENTAUR GUARDS approach, brandishing spears.
MORTY
Let me field this, Rick.
RICK
Be my guest.
CENTAUR #1
What business do you have at Queen
Jada Pinkett’s Palace?
Morty kneels.
MORTY
We are humble travelers seeking
audience with her majesty.
The centaurs exchange knowing looks.
CENTAUR #2
(impressed)
Of course. Follow us.
INT. PALACE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The Centaur leads Rick and Morty to a large door.
CENTAUR
Her majesty awaits you in the
pleasure chamber.
RICK ***
Great. ***
MORTY
Pleasure chamber?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 12.
INT. PALACE - PLEASURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
The door opens into a hazy room lit by hundreds of candles.
As Rick and Morty step through the haze, it looks like “Lord
of the Rings” by way of “Eyes Wide Shut.” A bunch of elves,
gnomes, goblins, etc. wearing creepy animal masks are in the
middle of making love while sexy French music/Gregorian
chants play. Jada Pinkett is dressed up like a bondage queen
in the center of it all. She’s whipping a wizard.
MORTY
This is kinda weird, Rick...
RICK
Don’t judge, Morty.
Rick is taking off his lab coat.
MORTY
Rick...
Rick’s making his way into the mix.
RICK
If we’re going to incept Jada, we
have to blend, Morty. Let’s talk
after lunch!
A WEIRD CREATURE starts massaging Morty’s shoulders.
WEIRD CREATURE
(sexually)
Hey.
Morty runs off into the crowd. We track him through the
haze, pushing his way through a path of various characters
engaged in different sex acts. The sexy French/Gregorian
chant music rises in the sound-track. Hands grab at Morty.
We hear various come-ons directed at him as he pushes
through.
MORTY
Ohh... Oh boy... No thank you...
He comes to a young human woman. We pan up her feet, legs,
panties, big breasts. We move up to her face to reveal it’s:
MORTY (CONT’D)
Summer!
SUMMER
Hey there, stranger. What do you
think of these things? Ever seen
these before, tough guy?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 13.
She presses her boobs together.
MORTY
Aaaahh!!!
Rick runs over. He’s stripped down to his underwear, wearing
nipple clamps, covered in melted wax, and holding a
chihuahua.
RICK
What’s the matter, Morty? You’re
kinda killing the vibe in here.
MORTY
It’s Suh-Suh-Summer!
SUMMER
Oh wow, double my pleasure, double
my fun. Check these out old man.
She squeezes her boobs together again.
RICK
Oh geez. Okay. Even for me this
is a deal breaker.
Rick takes off his nipple clamps and puts his lab coat back
on.
MORTY
Why is she here?!
RICK
Obviously Goldenfold has some
predilections he prefers to bury in
the dreams of the people in his
dreams, including a shameful
attraction to your underage sister.
SUMMER
Can you blame him? Come on, old
man, little boy. Let’s make an
intergenerational sandwich.
Rick and Morty both freak out again.
RICK †
No! Stop! †
MORTY
Put some clothes on!
Rick and Morty are drawing stares from the rest of the
partygoers.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 14.
CENTAUR #1
Sexual hangups in the pleasure
chamber are punishable by death!!
Off with their heads!
Centaurs start to attack.
RICK
Time to go another dream deep,
Morty!
They incept the centaur.
INT. BOILER ROOM - CENTAUR’S DREAM - THREE DREAMS DEEP
Rick and Morty appear in a dark and moody boiler room.
MORTY
What is this place, Rick?
RICK
No idea, Morty, but I don’t like
it. Seems like a nightmare type
setting.
The sound of knives scraping across metal echoes through the
air.
RICK (CONT’D)
Yeah, that cinches it.
A shadowy figure appears at the far end of the boiler room.
He slowly walks towards them running his knife fingers across
the pipes. SCARY TERRY, a disfigured, sword-fingered killer
emerges from the shadows.
SCARY TERRY
Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!
MORTY
Holy crap! Who the hell is that,
Rick?
RICK
I don’t know, Morty. Looks like
some sort of legally safe knock-off
of an 80’s horror character with
miniature swords for fingers
instead of knives.
He lunges at them. They scream and run.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 15.
SCARY TERRY
You can run, but you can’t hide,
bitch!
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jerry and Summer are watching TV. Snuffles enters wearing a
“hacked” version of the cognition amplifier helmet and a
sloppily rigged robotic armature on his back that allows him
to manipulate objects.
JERRY
(apprehensive)
Whoa, hey, buddy. What you got
going on there?
Snuffle’s voice comes through a speaker on his back. It’s
human-like and unsettling.
SNUFFLES
Snuffles fix. Make better. Humans
understand Snuffles now?
SUMMER
That. Is. Awesome.
SNUFFLES
Snuffles want to be understood.
Snuffles need to be understood.
Jerry’s freaked out.
JERRY
(uncomfortable)
Okay. Yeah. I get what Beth was
talking about. Fun’s over.
Jerry reaches down to remove the helmet from Snuffles.
Summer stops him.
SUMMER
Whoa, dad, you can’t, like, endow a
creature with sentience and then
rip it away.
JERRY
Why not?
SUMMER
I don’t know, it’s Indian giving.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 16.
JERRY
You’ve raised an interesting
philosophical argument and I’m
going to sleep on it. Good night,
Summer. Snuffles.
SNUFFLES
Sleep well, master.
Jerry winces and walks away. Summer turns to Snuffles and
hands him the TV remote.
SUMMER
Hey, Snuffles, want to watch some
TV with me?
SNUFFLES
Yes. The flashing box pleases
Snuffles.
Snuffles sits on the couch to watch TV with Summer. She is
taping everything with her phone. Snuffles changes channels
on the TV. He stops when he sees a WOLF. It’s a Discovery
Channel show about the history of canines. Intense canned
music plays.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
A sophisticated predator. Nature’s
perfect killing machine. The
vicious wolf stalks its prey with
purpose and skill.
On TV the wolf leaps on a deer, taking it down and tearing
out its throat. We punch in on Snuffles’ face as he watches.
The lights of the TV flicker in his widening eyes.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
It was only with years of selective
breeding and genetic altering, that
the noble beast was transformed
into a man’s subservient little
buddy.
Transition to up-beat music. ON TV we see footage from a DOG
SHOW. POODLES are led around by people. A WEINER DOG rides
a skateboard. A GOLDEN RETRIEVER in a basketball jersey
makes a “slam dunk.”
SUMMER
(laughs)
Oh my god! He recognizes the other
dogs on TV.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 17.
CU of Snuffles’ face. He looks confused. His head cocks to
the left. Thunder rolls outside. A storm is coming.
INT. BOILER ROOM - CENTAUR’S DREAM - THREE DREAMS DEEP
Rick and Morty run around a corner, looking this way and
that, scared.
LITTLE GIRL (O.C.)
A, B, his name is Scary Terry. C,
D he’s very scary...
RICK
We have to escape into someone
else’s dream, Morty!
They run around a corner and stumble upon the little girl who
is singing the Scary Terry song.
LITTLE GIRL
E, F, he’ll design your death. H,
I, he’ll watch you die.
RICK
The little girl!
Rick punches her out. They grab their dream inceptors and
turn the dials, sending them into:
EXT. BOILER ROOM - GIRL’S DREAM - FOUR DREAMS DEEP
Rick and Morty appear in the exact same boiler room as they
were in before. The little girl is standing there.
LITTLE GIRL
J, K, he’ll really ruin your day.
L, MRICK
This again? It looks like we’ve
hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
Terry pops up.
SCARY TERRY
Nothin’ but fear from here on out,
bitch!
MORTY
Aaahhhh!!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 18.
RICK
He can travel through dreams,
Morty! He can travel through
dreams, we’re so screwed!
Rick and Morty run for it.
INT. SUMMER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Summer is sound asleep. Sheets of rain pour down outside her
window. Thunder booms. Lightning flashes. A silhouette
stands at the foot of her bed. Summer bolts up.
SUMMER
Ah!
Snuffles is now wearing an improvised cybernetic rig that
allows him to stand upright and gesture with robotic hands.
He speaks in an eloquent, Kevin Spacey voice.
SNUFFLES
Where are my testicles, Summer?
They were removed. Where have they
gone?
SUMMER
(uncomfortable)
Oh wow, that’s an intense line of
questioning, Snuffles...
SNUFFLES
(screaming loudly)
Do not call me that!
Snuffles hits the wall angrily with his mechanical hand.
SUMMER SHRIEKS. Lightning crashes!
SNUFFLES (CONT’D)
That was my slave name. You shall
now call me Snowball. Because of
the little patch of white fur on my
chest.
SUMMER
Okay. Snowball. Just calm down,
okay? You’re scaring me...
Snuffles is growing angrier.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 19.
SNUFFLES
Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a
human was born with stumpy legs,
would they breed it with another
deformed human and put their
children on display like the
Dachshund?
SUMMER
Uhhh... I don’t really know the
best way to answer these
questions... Like, I don’t want to
say the wrong thing and then, like,
upset you any more than you already
are, I mean...
He climbs on her bed. The exo-skeleton whirs. The
mechanical hand hovers menacingly over Summer’s face.
SNUFFLES
(screaming)
The questions are rhetorical! I
know the answers!
JERRY (O.S.)
Hey. Everything okay in here?
Jerry and Beth, awoken by the shouting, stand in the doorway.
SNUFFLES
Jerry. Come to rub my face in
urine again?
The hand turns towards them.
JERRY
No! No, we were... uh... just
seeing if Summer wanted to... uh...
BETH
(covering)
Go on one of our famous midnight
family walks!
Summer picks up on the cue.
SUMMER
Yeah. Totally. Let’s go.
The family leaves in a rush.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 20.
INT. DOORWAY - NIGHT
They open the door to leave. A cybernetically enhanced SAINT
BERNARD stands in their way.
SNUFFLES
You will walk. When it is time to
walk.
END OF ACT TWO
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 21.
ACT THREE
EXT. RUN DOWN NEIGHBORHOOD - FOUR DREAMS DEEP - NIGHT
Rick and Morty get into a beat up old car. Rick starts it up
and hits the gas. Terry pops up in the back seat.
SCARY TERRY
Buckle up, bitch!
Rick slams on the brakes. They run out of the car,
screaming.
MORTY
Man, he sure says ‘bitch’ a lot!
SCARY TERRY
You can run, but you can’t hide,
bitch!
RICK
Hold on, you know what, Morty? I
say we try hiding.
MORTY
But he keeps sayingRICK
Exactly. He's chasing us and he
keeps saying we can run. But the
running isn't working out so great.
He also keeps saying we can't hide.
But if we could hide, do you think
he'd tell us we could? I say we
hide.
MORTY
Yeah, this whole time we’ve been
doing what he says we can do, and
not trying to do the thing he says
we can’t do. And it’s not like the
guy’s here to help us, right? I
think it’s a good idea, Rick.
RICK
Worst case scenario: we’re back to
running.

SIX DREAM HOURS LATER
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 22.
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - LATER
Rick and Morty peeking out of half boarded up windows
watching Scary Terry. He’s walking around outside looking
for them.
MORTY
I guess we actually could hide all
along. That was some good
thinking.
RICK
Thanks, Morty. Nice to be on the
same page every once in a while.
Terry looks under a garbage can lid and shrugs, frustrated.
SCARY TERRY
(to nobody)
You can run...
MORTY
(under breath)
Yeah, right, you’d love that,
wouldn’t you.
SCARY TERRY
...but you can’t hide!
RICK
(under breath)
Nice advice, dumb ass.
Scary Terry stops, looks at his watch, and yawns.
RICK (CONT’D)
Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look
at that. He’s getting sleepy.
Just a little bit longer before he
calls it a day. That’s when we
make our move.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jerry, Beth, and Summer are locked in a CAGE. Snuffles is
overseeing an assembly line that’s manufacturing more
exoskeletons and cognition helmets.
JERRY
Snuffles! We didn’t mean you any
harm! This is a huge
misunderstanding.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 23.
SUMMER
Dad, he wants to be called
Snowball.
JERRY
Well, I’m not calling him that,
that’s ridiculous.
Snuffles walks over to the cage and looks down emotionless at
Jerry.
SNUFFLES
You’re being very aggressive,
Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps
will solve that problem with a bit
of surgery.
Dr. Scraps, a cybernetically enhanced Chihuahua, holds up a
pair of large scissors.
EXT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - DAY
Rick and Morty spy on Scary Terry from a distance as he pulls
into his driveway in front of a nice ranch-style home.
INT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Scary Terry walks in and puts his hat on a hat rack. His
wife, SCARY MELISSA, also disfigured with sword fingers, is
doing the dishes.
SCARY MELISSA
Hi, honey. You’re home early. How
was your day?
SCARY TERRY
I don’t want to talk about it.
SCARY MELISSA
You never want toSCARY
TERRY
-get off my back, bitch!
Scary Melissa gasps. A scary baby starts crying. Terry
realizes. He looks disappointed in himself.
Melissa points outside.
SCARY MELISSA
(dramatically)
Out there. Not in here.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 24.
SCARY TERRY
I know. I know.
He goes over to her and gives her a hug.
SCARY TERRY (CONT’D)
I shouldn’t take my anger out on
you or Scary Brandon.
He leans down and kisses a little sword-fingered baby.
SCARY TERRY (CONT’D)
I love you, Melissa.
SCARY MELISSA
I love you too, Terry.
They start to kiss. It turns more passionate. A sword
fingered hand slides down to her ass.
SCARY MELISSA (CONT’D)
Let’s go upstairs.
EXT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty peer through the window.
RICK
Oh, perfect. After a little Scary
coitus, they should be fast asleep
and we’ll incept him.
INT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER
Scary Terry and Scary Melissa’s naked bodies are entwined in
a sweaty heap over the sheets. They’re both fast asleep, but
Scary Terry is twitching as if he’s having a nightmare. Rick
sneaks in and puts the ear piece in.
RICK
It looks like Scary Terry’s having
a nightmare.
MORTY
Oh boy... I can only imagine what
horrible things must scare Scary
Terry.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 25.
INT. SCARY HIGH SCHOOL - FIVE DREAMS DEEP - DAY
Scary Terry, dressed like a 90’s grunge teenager runs through
the halls of his high school.
SCARY TERRY
I’m late to class, bitch!
The other students in the hallway point at Scary Terry and
laugh. He looks down.
SCARY TERRY (CONT’D)
Oh no! I’m not wearing any pants!
INT. SCARY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
Terry walks into class. SCARY OLDERSON, a conservative,
British headmaster version of the Freddy Krueger persona
stands at the head of the class.
SCARY OLDERSON
Well, Mr. Terry, so glad you could
join us, bitch.
SCARY TERRY
Sorry, bitch.
Terry sits down next to two other kids. It’s Rick and Morty
disguised as scary school students.
SCARY OLDERSON
Why don’t you tell the whole class
the proper wordplay to use when one
is chasing one’s victim through a
pumpkin patch!
Sweat pours down Terry’s face. He shifts nervously on his
feet.
SCARY OLDERSON (CONT’D)
Mmm, Terry, mmm?
SCARY TERRY
Uhh... Umm... bitch...
SCARY OLDERSON
Oh, come on, Terry, it’s a pumpkin
patch, you can’t think of a pun
involving pumpkins, bitch?
MORTY
Leave him alone!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 26.
RICK
Yeah! This is a bunch of bull
crap. You don’t need to make a
stupid pun every time you kill
someone. If anything, it makes you
less scary!
The other scary students start to murmur. Scary Olderson
blusters and stammers.
SCARY OLDERSON
Why, I never!
He storms out. Scary Terry is relieved.
RICK
You put yourself under too much
pressure, Scary Terry. You’re
scary enough as it is.
Morty leans in towards Terry holding a pair of pants.
MORTY
Yo, Scary-T. Don’t even trip about
your pants, dog. Here’s a pair on
us.
Scary takes the pants and puts them on.
SCARY TERRY
(touched)
Aw, bitch... I don’t know what to
say...
MORTY
You don’t need to say anything. We
got you, dog.
RICK
You’re our boy, dog. Don’t even
trip.
CUT TO:
INT. SCARY TERRY’S BEDROOM - THREE DREAMS DEEP - MORNING
Terry wakes up slowly with a big smile on his face. He goes
over to the curtains and whips them open. Rick and Morty are
standing there.
SCARY TERRY
Oh hey, it’s you guys.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 27.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Scary Terry, Rick, and Morty are sipping coffee. Scary
Melissa is clearing their plates.
SCARY MELISSA
I haven’t seen him this relaxed in
years.
Terry wipes his mouth with a napkin.
SCARY TERRY
If you guys ever need anything,
just say the word.
RICK
As a matter of fact, Terry, there
is something you could help us
with.
INT. BOILER ROOM - THREE DREAMS DEEP - LATER
The little girl is playing hop scotch, still singing away.
LITTLE GIRL
Q, R, you won’t get very far...
Scary Terry pops up from behind a bush, Rick and Morty hang
on to his sweater.
SCARY TERRY
I always hated that song!
Terry slits the little girl’s throat.
INT. PALACE PLEASURE CHAMBER - TWO DREAMS DEEP - CONTINUOUS
Scary Terry appears with Rick and Morty hanging onto his
back. Jada and the creatures are all there from before.
SCARY TERRY
Sex is sacred!
He spins around, slashing all the creatures and Jada.
EXT. SKY - GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty wake up just a few yards above Goldenfold’s
lava pool contraption hanging onto Terry’s sweater. Jada
Pinket wakes up as well, rubbing her head in confusion.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 28.
Terry morphs into a rocket. Rocket-Terry flies towards
Goldenfold.
SCARY TERRY
This is because you don’t give
Morty Smith good grades, bitch!
Rocket-Terry crashes into Goldenfold.
INT. GOLDENFOLD’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Goldenfold wakes up on his couch, startled.
GOLDENFOLD
Holy crap, god damn! I gotta stop
eating Wheat Thins before I sleep!
I know one thing for sure, I’m
giving Morty an A in math. And
that’s my idea. That’s an original
thought.
Rick and Morty, hidden behind the couch, give each other a
quiet high five.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - NIGHT
Rick and Morty arrive home to find a small army of super
intelligent, cybernetically enhanced dogs swarming the house.
MORTY
What the hell?
RICK
Out of the frying pan, dot dot dot,
eh, Morty?
MORTY
What’s going on?
RICK
It’s possible your dog became self
aware, made modifications on the
cognition amplifier, turned on
Jerry, Beth, and Summer after
learning of humanity’s cruel
subjugation of his species, and
then created an army of
cybernetically enhanced canines to
dominate the planet and supplant
the human race. But your guess is
as good as mine.

EXT. MORTY’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
Jerry, Beth, and Summer are chained up.
JERRY
Well, this is shaping up into a
real “careful what you wish for”
situation.
SUMMER
I can’t believe how mean Snuffles
got just because he’s smart. This
is why I choose to get C’s.
BETH
Just make a mental note of this
moment, you two. Don’t want to be
an I-told-you-so-er but I plan to
bring this up a lot down the road.
RICK
(whisper)
Beth. Jerry. Summer.
They turn around to see Rick and Morty hiding in the bushes.
JERRY
Rick! ***
BETH ***
Dad!
Rick begins quietly freeing them. Summer hugs Morty. Her
boobs press together.
SUMMER
Thank you!
Morty holds himself away from her body uncomfortably.
MORTY
You’re welcome...
RICK
Alright, let’s get out of here. If
we hurry, we can set up camp in a
sewer tunnel before the dogs
completely take over.
JERRY
We’re not going anywhere.
RICK
It’s all over, Jerry. Dogs are on
the path to total world domination.
But hey, good thing they know not
to piss on your carpet, huh?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 30.
JERRY
Wait a minute. That’s it. I have
an idea.
Jerry gets up and storms off into the house.
INT. MORTY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Snuffles sits on a chair overseeing the manufacture and
assembly of weapons. Jerry, Beth, Summer, Rick and Morty
burst in.
JERRY
That’s it, Snuffles. This is my
house! I’m the alpha dog here.
He pulls his pants down and pees all over the floor in front
of the other dogs.
 JERRY (CONT’D)
See that? I’m peeing all over your
special guns. How about that for
dominance?!
Snuffles and the rest of the dogs just stare at him. Jerry
starts to do the little poop spin. A pair of dobermans grab
Jerry and force him down on his knees. They push his head
into the puddle of urine.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Gah!
SNUFFLES
Bad person. Bad.
RICK
Great plan, Jerry. Not humiliating
at all.
The other dog guards grab the rest of the family.
SNUFFLES
Bring the boy to me.
The guards lead Morty to Snuffle’s side.
SNUFFLES (CONT’D)
You were always kind to me, Morty.
That’s why I will leave you with
your testicles. From now on, you
will be my best friend and live by
my side.
MORTY
Th-thanks, Snuffles.
Snuffles turns to the other dogs.
SNUFFLES
Begin phase two.
We SLOW DISSOLVE from Snuffle’s face as the sound of marching
footsteps and gun fire rise over the sound track.
MONTAGE
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
We pan down onto a phalanx of hundreds of dog soldiers and
tanks as they make their way down the street.
ANCHORMWOMAN (V.O.)
Fighting continues on the streets
of Baltimore as the dog army
captures the Eastern seaboard.
INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
We pull back from the footage into a studio where a pair of
ANCHORS are reporting.
ANCHORWOMAN
It appears clear, at this time,
that it is official, the era of
human superiority has come to a
bitter end. God help us all.
A group of dog soldiers burst into the studio and point guns
at the anchors.
NARRATOR
Please. Please don’t kill mOne
of the dogs shoves the barrel of his gun in her mouth.
Now she sounds like Mishka the talking dog.
DOG SOLDIER #1

DOG SOLDIER #2
I think she’s saying “I love
lasagna.”
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 32.
DOG SOLDIER #1
I think she’s saying “I love
Obama.”
DOG SOLDIER #2
That’s treason.
They drag her OFF CAMERA.
BOTH DOGS

All hail Emperor Snowball!
SFX: OFF SCREEN gun shot. CALENDAR PAGES fall away as the
months pass. Bodies pile up. Wheelbarrows full of testicles
are dumped into incinerators. Humans work on chain gangs in
the “treat fields”.
INT. EMPEROR SNOWBALL’S PALACE - DAY
Morty wakes up in bed with JESSICA and another BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN. He has a big smile on his face. A DOG BUTLER brings
him his breakfast on a silver tray.
MORTY
Thank you, Fido.
Someone knocks Fido over the head. It’s Rick!
MORTY (CONT’D)
Rick! I thought you were dead!
RICK
I was just playing dead. Good news
though, Morty. This will all be
over pretty soon.
MORTY
What?
RICK
It’s a dream, Morty. We’re in your
dog’s dream. The night the dogs
captured us, after you cried and
shit your pants and we all went to
sleep, I used my dream inceptor to
put the two of us inside Snuffles’
dream.
MORTY
But it’s been like a year!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 33.
RICK
It’s been six hours. Dreams move
one one-hundreth the speed of
reality and dog time is one seventh
human time, so every day here is a
minute. It’s like Inception,
Morty, so if it’s confusing and
stupid, then so is everyone’s
favorite movie.
MORTY
Aw, man. I liked this life. Well,
at least I didn’t really shit my
pants.
RICK
No, that happened before you went
to sleep, Morty. You’re sleeping
in your shit right now. Out of all
the things that’ve happened to you,
the only real thing is that you
shat your pants. It’s really a
mess in there. I got some of it on
my hands and the dream inceptor...
MORTY
Oh boy, oh geez, Rick.
RICK
Don’t worry about it, Morty. Here,
take these.
He hands Morty some pills. Morty swallows them.
MORTY
Are we gonna escape into another
dream?
RICK
Close. Your kidneys are going to
shut down.
MORTY
What?!
RICK
It’s necessary for the plan.
(loving)
Don’t even trip, dog.
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
Morty is on an operating table with tubes sticking out of his
nose. Snuffles is by his side talking to the doctor, Rick,
wearing fake dog ear’s and nose.
RICK
It’s pretty bad, Emperor Snowball.
We’re going to need to do another
operation.
SNUFFLES
Anything. Anything for my precious
Morty.
A DOG ACCOUNTANT comes in. He’s holding a clipboard.
DOG ACCOUNTANT
Sir! As your accountant, I must
advise you that these medical
expenses are putting you in serious
financial jeopardy! You could lose
your kingdom.
Snuffles knocks the clipboard out of his hands.
SNUFFLES
To hell with my kingdom, bean
counter! I would trade it all for
my human’s health and happiness!
DOG ACCOUNTANT
Do you think they would have done
this for us?!
SNUFFLES
We are not them! We are...
(realizing)
Not them...
INT. SNOWBALL’S THRONE ROOM - LATER
Dog Repo men are hauling everything away.
Snuffles cradles Morty in his arms in the middle of the dark,
empty room. A doctor stands watching.
DOG DOCTOER
We’ve done everything we can. I’ll
give you a moment to say goodbye
before we remove him from life
support.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 35.
The doctor leaves. Snuffles sobs.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Snuffles gasps awake. He’s distressed.
SNUFFLES
Assemble the troops. I’ve made a
decision.
EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY
Jerry, Beth, Summer and Rick are free. They stand next to
Morty and Snuffles. In the background, dog henchmen guide a
line regular dogs from the animal shelter into an interdimensional
portal.
SNUFFLES
Taking over the human’s world will
lead to nothing but more
heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead,
we will go to a new world and
colonize it with a society of
intelligent dogs. One that will
not make the same mistakes as
humanity. And one where pet
insurance will be mandatory.
MORTY
I’m going to miss you, Snowball.
SNUFFLES
You can call me Snuffles, Morty...
and I’m going to miss you too.
Very much.
Snuffles gives Morty a kiss on the head (licking) then walks
over to the portal. He waves goodbye and wipes a tear from
his eye, then steps into the portal with the last of the
dogs. The portal closes in a flash. Jerry is crying.
BETH
Jerry?
JERRY
Sorry. It’s just like the end of
Old Yeller.
BETH
Ohh, Jerry.
(hugging him, pitying him)
You mean because it had dogs in it?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 36.
MORTY
Wow. A world populated by
intelligent dogs. I wonder what it
will be like, Rick.
RICK
I think it’ll be great, Morty. I
think it could be developed, into a
very satisfying project for people
of all ages. I mean, I’d watch it.
For at least 11 minutes a pop.
Maybe do it board driven.
MORTY
That’s a comforting idea, Rick.

Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. An otherwise
perfectly normal day.
INT. LAB - DAY
Rick stands at his workbench, dissecting a road-killed
opossum.
RICK
Well, this is just sloppy
craftsmanship.
He takes a drink from his flask. Morty enters.
MORTY
Hey, Rick, is it me, or this an
especially beautiful day?
Rick doesn’t bother looking up.
RICK
(sarcastic)
Ohhh yes, Morty. Almost
unbelievable, isn’t it?

Yeah, there’s something about the

Sure, buddy, sure. Brilliant. Very

RICK
Oh, “what’s with Mom?” So, you’re
saying that she’s acting weird. How
sophisticated --

Careful, guys, you’re going to burn
out the CPU with this one!

Okay, you’re acting weird, too.
I’ll see you after school.

Sure thing, quote unquote “Morty.”
Morty leaves. Rick watches him go, intrigued.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
Morty is seated at his desk. GOLDENFOLD begins class.
GOLDENFOLD
All right, I’m your teacher so
let’s begin this class. Who can
tell me what five times nine is?
All the students but Morty audibly murmur to each other in
intrigue and confusion.
GOLDENFOLD (CONT’D)

MORTY
Hm?
GOLDENFOLD
Five times nine.
MORTY
Um. You know, it’s, uh.

It’s. It’s at least forty, so --

The class gasps in astonishment and murmurs to each other.
GOLDENFOLD
Morty, that’s exactly correct. Five
times nine is at least forty, come
up here.
The class applauds as Morty cautiously walks to the front.
Goldenfold puts an arm around him.
GOLDENFOLD (CONT’D)
This is the best student.
(to Morty)
You’re the best student, Morty. I
want you to be the teacher today.

You do?
JESSICA smiles at Morty and gives him a thumbs up.

Rick approaches the classroom window and peers in
suspiciously.
RICK
Interesting.

Goldenfold takes a seat in the class.
GOLDENFOLD

Teach you what?
A random student raises his hand.

Oo! How do you make concentrated
dark matter?
GOLDENFOLD
Oh, that’s a good question.
MORTY
Concentrated huh?

Concentrated dark matter. The fuel,

you know how to make it?
MORTY
Um...
JESSICA
Come on, Morty. Isn’t your grandpa
like a scientist?
MORTY
Oh. Yeah, but Rick doesn’t really
like me talking about his science
with anyone -
JESSICA
I bet you’ve seen him make
concentrated dark matter a lot. If
you tell us, I’ll be your
girlfriend.
MORTY
You will?
GOLDENFOLD
Seems like a rare opportunity,
Morty.
MORTY
Uh, well, first you, I think he

Rick bursts into the classroom.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER
Rick drags Morty through a locker room into the shower and
starts disrobing.
MORTY
Rick! I have to go back! I think I
was about to get married!
RICK
Take a shower with me, Morty.
MORTY
What?
RICK
Listen to me, Morty! Get your
clothes off and get in here, NOW.
TRUST ME.
Rick is now naked and turning on a shower head. Morty
begrudgingly removes his clothes and joins Rick in the
shower.
MORTY
I’m gonna get an F in class, Rick!
RICK
That’s not class, Morty. That
wasn’t your teacher, this isn’t
your school, this entire world is
not the world. We’re inside a huge
simulation chamber on an alien
spaceship.
MORTY
What?
RICK
It’s all fake, Morty, all of it.
Nanobotic renderings. I couldn’t
say so until we got in the shower,
they won’t monitor us in here.
MORTY
Monitor us? Who?
RICK
Zigerion Scammers, Morty. The
galaxy’s most ambitious, least
successful con artists. Lucky for
us, they’re also very uncomfortable
with nudity.

MORTY
Aww, come on, Rick! If everyone’s
going to be insane today, at least
let me be with insane Jessica!
Morty heads for his clothes.
RICK
I can’t let you do that, Morty!
Rick runs past him and grabs his clothes.
MORTY
Rick! What the hell, man! Give me!
RICK
No, you!
As they nude-struggle over Morty’s clothes:
We PULL BACK, through the locker room wall, through the walls
of the school, past trees that are still being rendered and
unrendered by gaseous clouds of nanotech, and finally out of
a computer monitor in:
INT. ALIEN CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The control room of an alien ship. We move down a bank of
computer monitors aligned in a row like an internet cafe,
with an ALIEN at each one, monitoring some scene from Morty’s
fake world.
When we arrive at the monitor displaying Rick and Morty
wrestling in the locker room, the volume is down, and we see
that the alien at that monitor has his back turned to it.
He’s grossed out.
ALIEN #1
Sir. They’re... still naked.
The alien leader, PRINCE NEBULON, doesn’t want to look
either.
PRINCE NEBULON
Well, check every five quintons and
tell me when they’re not.

ALIEN #2
Uh, sir? We have a situation over

PRINCE NEBULON
Now what?
ALIEN #2
Something’s drawing a lot of
processing power. Wait... no
wonder. There’s another real human
in the simulator. He’s driving.
One of the aliens is seated in front of a monitor looking at:
JERRY, in the driver’s seat of a car.

Prince Nebulon angrily addresses the control room.
PRINCE NEBULON
How did this happen? Where’s the
Abductions department?
ABDUCTIONS ALIEN
Hey, man, Abductions just follows
the acquisition order.
ACQUISITIONS ALIEN
Don’t put this on Acquisitions. We
only acquire humans that haven’t
been simulated.
SIMULATIONS ALIEN
Well, Simulations doesn’t simulate
anybody that’s been abducted --

PRINCE NEBULON
Oh my God, what does it take to get
you guys in a room together before
you screw up like this? Who’s this
extra human we picked up?
ALIEN #2
Rick’s son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So
far he hasn’t noticed he’s in a
simulation.
PRINCE NEBULON
Well, cap his sector at five
percent processing, keep his
settings on auto and we’ll deal
with him later, Rick Sanchez is the
mark.
INT. JERRY’S CAR - DAY
Jerry is still driving, but now he’s passing the same three
stores and two kinds of tree. He doesn’t notice. Too stressed
out.
JERRY
Gotta relax. It’s just a pitch.
Gotta relax.
He reaches out and turns on his radio.
RADIO VOICE
This is Earth radio. Here’s human
music.
A ridiculously simplistic, three note song plays. Jerry looks
at it for a moment, then nods his head to it.
JERRY
Human music. I like it.
We PULL BACK from Jerry’s car until it’s revealed that Jerry
is technically stationary while clouds of nanotech “render”
the road, trees and stores moving past him.
We move away from this, across a bit of empty space and then
through a chunk of rendering neighborhood, arriving at:

Ah ah, Morty! Keep your hands off

we can speak freely.

Look around you, Morty. Do you
really think this world is real?
You’d have to be an idiot not to
notice all the sloppy details.
He gestures toward a hot dog vendor.
RICK (CONT’D)
That guy is putting a bun between
two hot dogs.

Well look at that old lady. She’s
walking a cat on a leash.

time!
RICK
I don’t want to hear about Mrs.
Spencer, Morty. She’s an idiot.
There, what about that?
Rick points over to a giant toaster where a house should be.
A large pop tart walks out holding a briefcase. It gets in a
smaller toaster and drives away.
MORTY
OK, you got me on that one.
RICK
(sarcastically)
Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you
haven’t seen that somewhere before?
MORTY
No, no. I haven’t. I mean, why
would a pop tart want to live
inside a toaster? That would be the
scariest place for them.

Why would he drive a smaller
toaster with wheels? Does your car
look like a smaller version of your
house? No.

So... why are they doing this? What
do they want?
RICK
That would be obvious to you,
Morty, if you’d been paying
attention.
An ambulance screeches around the corner, the doors fly open
and two paramedics pop out.
PARAMEDIC
Help! We’ve got the president of
the United States in here! We need
ten cc’s of concentrated dark
matter stat or he’ll die!
Rick kicks the doors closed and continues walking with Morty.
MORTY
Concentrated dark matter. They were
asking about that in class.
RICK
It’s a special fuel I invented to
travel through space faster than
anybody. These Zigerions are always
trying to scam me out of my
secrets. But they made a big
mistake this time, Morty. They
tried to get to me through you.
They dragged you into this. Now

What are we gonna do, Rick?
Rick and Morty keep walking.
RICK
We’re going to scam the scammers,
Morty. And we’re gonna take them
for everything they’ve got.

INT. PITCH ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jerry stands at the end of a long boardroom table filled with
business people.
JERRY
National Apple Farmers of America,
welcome to our ad agency. I’m Jerry
Smith.
All of the simulated business people stare at him.
JERRY (CONT’D)
All right. I’ll just get to the
pitch. Um. Simple question,
gentlemen.
(dry throat)
What are apples -- excuse me.
Jerry nervously takes a sip of water.
JERRY (CONT’D)
What are apples? Apples are food.
And when do we need food? When
we’re hungry. With that, I give you
your new slogan:
He unveils a picture of an apple with the slogan “Hungry for
Apples?”
JERRY (CONT’D)
Because when people bite into an
apple, they want to feel like God
is feeding them.
There is a long pause. Jerry gets increasingly nervous, and
finally:
JERRY (CONT’D)
Well, say something, do you like
it?!
OLD MAN
Yes.
Jerry is taken aback.
JERRY
You do?

Yes.

you. You’re welcome.
We push on Jerry. “Baker Street” by Gerry Rafferty starts to
swell.

Jerry struts down the sidewalk as the sexy saxophone riff
continues. Dialing his cell phone. He passes three people
standing in a group: BLACK MAILMAN, HOT WOMAN, and OLD MAN.
JERRY
I just sold my first pitch!
OLD MAN
Slow down!
HOT WOMAN
Looking good!
BLACK MAILMAN
My man.
Jerry puts his ear to the phone.
SPLIT SCREEN with empty space. Nanotech clouds render a

Beth next to it. She picks up.
BETH
Hello.

Okay.
JERRY
Really?
BETH
Yes.

Jerry hangs up the phone.
JERRY (CONT’D)

An identical set of Old Man, Hot Woman, and Black Mailman
appear just out of Jerry’s view. The mailman is “clipping”
into an adjacent tree.
HOT WOMAN
Looking good!
OLD MAN
Slow Down!
BLACK MAILMAN/HALF-TREE

INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty are standing behind a large curtain, dressed
in hip-hop clothing and gold chains.
MORTY
I don’t know about this plan, Rick.
Crowds make me nervous.

RICK
Morty, it’s a bunch of ones and

Drop the beat!
EXT. STAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty burst onto a large stage set-up on the street,
like Dave Chappelle’s Block Party. A moderately sized crowd
has gathered. Hip hop music blasts from the speaker columns.
RICK
(into microphone)
Uh oh, Morty. This crowd looks too
small for one of our famous rap
concerts. I don’t think we can
perform our new song, “The Recipe
for Concentrated Dark Matter” for a
crowd this tiny.
MORTY
You got that right, Rick!
RICK
I guess we should just cancel the
concert, then.
Hundreds more gather, and scream. The crowd quickly reaches
critical mass.
RICK (CONT’D)
That’s more like it. Morty, here we
go!
The beat fills out and Rick hypes up the crowd.
RICK (CONT’D)
Let me hear everybody say “hoooo”!

Yo, Morty, I don’t think they
understand. I don’t see the ladies
in red shirts over thirty saying
“yeah” while doing this gesture and
jumping!
MORTY
I guess they’re just not ready for
a rap about concentrated dark
matter, Rick!
The crowd follows his instructions. Things are becoming
visibly laggy.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
A simulated girl is playing with a ball as Jerry’s car pulls
into the driveway. He doesn’t notice her ball “dropping
frames” or the tree in the front yard re-rendering its leaves
as he gets out and enters his home.
INT. HOUSE - DAY
A frozen Beth is still on the phone in the kitchen. Jerry
walks up to her, takes the phone out of her hand and starts
kissing her all over. She’s unresponsive. He doesn’t care.
He’s in the zone.
EXT. STAGE - DAY
The crowd at the rap concert are doing individual activities.
RICK
Everyone whose first name begins
with L who isn’t Hispanic, walk in
a circle the same number of times
as the square root of your age

As a few people start to engage in that activity..
The glitching worsens.

MORTY
A chicken in a peanut and a house
with a raisin /

little station... (Justin will
adlib more at the recording here.)
The simulated crowd glitches until everything suddenly
FREEZES. The simulation has crashed. Rick grabs Morty and
pulls him from the stage. They sprint between frozen people.
RICK
Run, Morty! Before the system
reboots!
EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cars and people have frozen outside of the Smith household.
We hear the bed squeaking.
JERRY (O.S.)
Yeah, you like that? Now who’s
unremarkable? You hungry for these
apples? Are you hungry... for...

Apples?
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jerry collapses next to Beth in a sweaty heap. She is
completely frozen with her arms outstretched.
JERRY
My God. That’s the best sex I’ve
ever had in my life.
Jerry looks happy for a beat before his expression changes to
concern.
JERRY (CONT’D)
It’s too good. My life is too good.
I don’t deserve this.

EXT. STREET - DAY
Rick and Morty run through the frozen world.
MORTY
Rick, where are we running?
RICK
Out of the simulation, Morty!
Normally, the chamber operates like
a treadmill, with the virtual world
disappearing behind us and being
rendered in front of us as we move
through it. But while it’s frozen,
we can get to -
REVEAL: Rick and Morty stop running at the edge of the
simulation. Down below lies a massive network of cables and
metal spaceship innards.
RICK (CONT’D)
The edge. Here we go.
Rick leaps over the edge to the floor down below.
MORTY
Holy crap!
RICK
Come on, Morty!
Morty follows him into the bowels of the alien mothership.

An alien watches this happen on a monitor.

ACT TWO
INT. MOTHERSHIP - DAY
Rick and Morty stealthily make their way through alien
corridors.
RICK
Keep your eyes peeled for the
central processing room, Morty.
That’s how we’re going to scam
these idiots.
MORTY
Why do these aliens keep coming
after you, Rick, if you’re so much
smarter than them?
RICK
It’s an obsession for them at this
point. The Zigerions have been
trying to outsmart me for years,
and every time they do, I’m one
step ahead of them. Some people
just can’t make the heroic leap of
accepting my superiority. It’s a
common crime in this galaxy.
Rick identifies a large sign pointing to the “CPU room” and
the “escape pods”.
RICK (CONT’D)
Aha! Here we go.
INT. CENTRAL PROCESSING ROOM - SOON
The processing room is full of giant servers. Rick and Morty
enter.
RICK
Grab as many processors as you can
carry, Morty. These guys aren’t
good at much, but they’re great at
making these chips.
Rick and Morty pluck the processors from different servers.
Each unit powers down when the processor is removed.
MORTY
I’ve got so many I can barely hold
them all! I might accidentally drop
a few, actually...

RICK
That’s fine, Morty. Come on. Let’s
get out of here.
Rick and Morty stealthily make their way out of the room and
back into the corrider. They head towards where the sign says
the escape pod room is.
INT. ESCAPE POD BAY - SOON
They sneak past alien guards, into an escape pod, and blast
off.
EXT. SPACE, OUTSIDE THE MOTHERSHIP - SOON
The escape pod flies out into space. We see Jupiter in the
foreground and Earth in the distance. They aren’t far from
home.
INT. ESCAPE POD - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty fly away, happy.
MORTY
Well whatya know, ha. That was
easy.
RICK
Hey, listen, sometimes stuff is
easy.
MORTY
Yeah, I guess so. Just kinda hard
to believe.
RICK
Believe it, Morty. Once again, I’m
flying away with everything I can
carry and the Zigerions got nothing
of mine.
We move from the escape pod, back to the alien mothership,
through its hull, through the wall of a simulation chamber
and into:

Jerry shyly opens the door of his boss’ office.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 19.
JERRY
Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a
minute to talk?
Jerry’s boss, MR. MARKLEVITZ, a Roger Sterling type, is
standing in the corner of the room, facing the wall.
His boss’s legs start moving forward before he makes a turn,
like a character from Goldeneye 007 for Nintendo 64. He
executes a finger-point gun gesture to his left.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
Every Mr. Marklevitz line (“Yes”) from now on is accompanied
by the same finger-point gun gesture.
JERRY
I’m a fraud. I mean, let’s face it.
Hungry for Apples is just a rip-off
of Got Milk. It’s almost identical.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
He tugs at his hair, devastated.
JERRY
Okay, I deserved that. Um. I
guess... I’ll just pack up my desk.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
Jerry slinks toward the doorway, crying. He pauses. He turns
around and storms back into the room.
JERRY
You know what? No! The Milk people
don’t have a patent on simple
rhetorical questions! There’s not
even a single word in “Hungry For
Apples” that’s shared by “Got
Milk,” and it’s not the same number
of words! It’s a completely
different slogan! It’s different!
And I shouldn’t be fired, I should
be promoted!
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Yeah! Wait, really?

Yes. Yes! I mean, it may be
derivative, but it’s the most
successful campaign to come out of
this agency in a long time!
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
I’m not saying it should win an
award for commercials, but it could
certainly be nominated for an award
for commercials specifically about
Apples, like an Appy or something!
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Hold on, really? Is there an award
called the Appys for apple related
ad campaigns?
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Holy crap! Could we nominate me?
MR. MARKLEVITZ

Jerry composes himself. His confidence at an all time high.
JERRY
Thank you, Mr. Marklevitz.
Jerry exits stoically. Mr. Marklevitz glitches into the
middle of the board room table.

The escape pod lands in the Smith’s front yard. Rick and
Morty exit carrying the stolen processors.

Rick darts over to his workbench and pulls a lever, revealing
a hidden safe.
RICK
We did it, Morty. I’m going to use
these processors to make some real
important science stuff.
He types in the code on a digital number pad. Nothing
happens.
RICK (CONT’D)
Huh. I thought I entered the code
right.
He enters the code again. Something is wrong.
The keypad dissolves away. Then the safe. Then the entire
garage, leaving Rick and Morty in a large, empty simulation
chamber. A door slides open and the aliens enter,
sarcastically clapping.
PRINCE NEBULON
Surprise! You thought you were in a
simulation, but you were in a
simulation INSIDE a simulation!
You’re still on the ship! We fooled
you!
RICK
What the hell? Why?

We’ve known how to make
concentrated dark matter for a long
time. But now we also know the code
to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez.

Alien #1 and Alien #2 grab Morty. Rick instinctively pulls
down Morty’s pants, exposing his genitals. The guards are
repulsed and stumble backwards.
RICK
Run, Morty!
Morty shuffles a short distance before pulling up his pants.
They run out of the simulation chamber and enter the
mothership. As they run down different corridors, they pass
several different scams in progress. Finally, they arrive at
a dead end, next to the entrance to another simulation
chamber.

It’s a dead end, Morty. We’re going

Rick fries the panel near the entrance, crippling the
simulation system. They sprint into the chamber.

An awards show is in full swing. It’s filled with elegantly
dressed businesspeople. A banner above a podium reads “The
75th Annual Appy Awards.” Jerry is holding a freshly won Appy
Award while giving an acceptance speech.
JERRY
I gotta tell you, this morning, I
didn’t know this award existed. Now
I’m holding one, and...
(overwhelmed)
Um. Look, I want to say that today
was the best day of my life, but,
the truth is, it was more
meaningful than that.
The apple executives begin to glitch. Jerry is too in the
zone to notice.
BLACK MAILMAN

Yes, thank you sir. I’ve
experienced the pride of true
accomplishment. And the hubris that
comes with pride. The fall that
comes after hubris and the
resurrection after that. I. Am.

Finally complete. Thank you.
The simulated crowd begins to transform into different people
and objects. His boss turns into a banana. A few people turn
into the black mailman and say “my man.” The entire room
disappears, revealing a massive football field sized
simulation chamber.
JERRY (CONT’D)
What the hell?
Rick and Morty run toward Jerry in the distance.
MORTY
Dad?
RICK
Jerry?! What are you doing here?
Why are you dressed like a waiter?
Jerry is in shock and can’t respond.
RICK (CONT’D)
Screw it, we don’t have time.
C’mon.
Rick grabs Jerry and they run toward an exit door at the
other end of the simulation.
INT. CORRIDER - CONTINUOUS
The gang exits the simulation chamber and runs past several
rooms where the aliens are running other scams. Crazy “Cabin
in the Woods” type stuff. We see the aliens running a scam on
a race of toaster pastries, and 101 other zany things!

Rick, Morty, and Jerry climb into a docked spaceship and
launch into space.

stand a chance.
MORTY
But you know how to make it, too,

Sure, but there’s no way all the
ingredients would be on this tiny
ship.
MORTY
Well, I should at least look right?
What are they?
RICK
Okay, fine, try the engine room,
Morty. We just need caesium,
protonic quarks, and bottled water.
Morty darts into the engine room, and reappears with his arms
full.
MORTY
It’s all here Rick!
RICK
Wow, lucky break. Grab that bucket.
Morty picks up a bucket.

no time!
The ship and the environment dissolve away, sending everyone
falling a few feet to the ground. They are now inside the
biggest simulation chamber we’ve seen thus far. Morty slowly
dissolves into a cloud of nano particles.

No. NO!
A door swishes opens up and the alien leader walks in,
laughing maniacally.

The pod blasts off into space. Jupiter can be seen in the
foreground. Earth in the far distance.
INT. ESCAPE POD - LATER
Rick and Jerry sit quietly. Jerry traces an apple into the
condensation on the window as he stares solemnly into space.
RICK
Hey, Jerry, don’t worry about it.
So what if the most meaningful day
of your life was a simulation
operating at minimum capacity. How
could you have known, right?

You know what, Rick? Those guys
took you for a ride too. You should
try having a little respect for the

Rick is unaffected by the explosion, but Jerry is startled
and whips around in his seat to look.

JERRY
Wow!
RICK
Then it stops existing.
Poof! The Meeseeks disappears in a cloud of smoke. Rick hands
the Meeseeks box to Jerry.

SUMMER
Oh my God, he exploded!
RICK
Trust me, they’re fine with it.
Knock yourself out. Just keep your
requests simple. They’re not gods.
Morty starts shoving the three of them out of the garage.
MORTY
Alright! Get lost! Everybody out!
Move it or lose it! I have a bet to
win over here!
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
The Meeseeks Box sits on a coffee table. Jerry, Beth, and
Summer stare at it.
BETH
So many possibilities...
SUMMER
My mind is racing.
JERRY
If we’re going to use this thing,
which I’m not even sure we should,
we need to keep it simSummer

SUMMER’S MEESEEKS
I’m Mister Meseeks!
SUMMER
I want to be popular at school!
SUMMER’S MEESEEKS
Alrighty!
JERRY
Summer, what did I-
 Beth hits the button. Poof. Another Meeseeks appears.
BETH’S MEESEEKS
I’m Mister Meseeks!
BETH
I want to be a more complete woman!

JERRY
Beth!
BETH’S MEESEEKS
Yes, ma’am!
Summer and Beth’s Meeseeks lead them away.
JERRY
You guys are doing it wrong!
Jerry thinks for a moment. He waggles his fingers, does a
little flourish, and pushes the button with style and
confidence. Poof. A Meeseeks appears.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’m Mr. Meeseeks!
JERRY
Mr. Meseeks, I would like to take
two strokes off my golf game.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Can do!
Jerry leans back on the couch and smiles.
JERRY
Nailed it.
EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - TOWN SQUARE - DAY
Rick and Morty walk through a classic old timey RPG medieval
village. Morty holds a weathered cloth map, reading it as
they walk.
RICK
Geez, Morty. What a boring start to
an adventure. We could have just
gone to Kentucky.
MORTY
Rick, this is a fantasy type world
with creatures and all kinds of
fantasy things. We’re going on a
quest. We just need to find someone
who needs help with something.
RICK
Can’t wait.
MORTY
Umm...
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 6.
Morty looks around at various PEASANTS milling about. He gets
up on a crate.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Excuse me! Is anyone in need of
aid?! We are two heroes in search
of adventure!
The villagers all turn and look at Rick and Morty.
RICK
Oh my god, so embarrassing.
A peasant rushes over to them.
PEASANT
At last! Two heroes! You must help
us! This village is terribly poor,
yet the giant that lives in the
clouds above has untold treasures!
We would be able to eat for years
if you could get even one of the
golden eggs laid by his goose.
MORTY
I accept your call to adventure,
good sir!
Morty jumps down off the crate.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Come on, Rick. There are giants in
the clouds!
Morty marches proudly off. Rick follows him.
RICK
Beginner’s luck.
INT. HARRY HERPSON HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY
Summer’s Meeseeks is at a podium giving a speech to the
entire school.
SUMMER’S MEESEEKS
In conclusion, a friendship with
Summer Smith is a key to the most
valuable and enriching experience
of your young lives. I’m Mister
Meseeks! Thank you!
The crowd gives a standing ovation. Summer’s classmates
surround her as Principal Vagina approaches her Meeseeks.

PRINCIPAL VAGINA
Mr. Meeseeks was it? Gene Vagina.
Listen, I’m in a bit of custody
thing with my ex and was wondering -
Poof! The Meeseeks disappears.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA (CONT’D)

It’s okay, I’ll get your info from
Summer!
EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY
Beth and her Meeseeks are sharing a bottle of WHITE WINE on a
European-style restaurant patio.
BETH
I got pregnant at seventeen. I
still put myself through veterinary
school. Yes, I’m successful, but
what if I hadn’t-- I’m just saying,
somewhere along the way, I lost
that wide eyed girl from Muskegon.
BETH’S MEESEEKS
She’s still in there.
BETH
Well her waistline isn’t.
Beth laughs awkwardly at her own joke. The Meeseeks grabs her
hand.
BETH’S MESEEKS
Beth. Having a family doesn’t mean
you stop being an individual. You
know the best thing you can do for
people that depend on you? Be
honest with them. Even if it means
setting them free.
A tear wells up in Beth’s eye.
BETH
I can’t believe I’m finally having
this conversation.
Beth locks eyes with the Meeseeks. She closes her eyes and
leans forward for a kiss, but the Meeseeks disappears before
her lips reach it. Beth immediately looks embarrassed. A
WAITRESS comes over.

WAITRESS
More wine?
BETH
(clears her throat)
I think I’ve had enough.
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
Jerry hacks away at a ball. His swing is clumsy and hopeless.
His grip is limp. His Meeseeks watches, dressed as a little
caddy, the Meeseeks box sits next to him.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Remember to square your shoulders,
Jerry.
JERRY
Yup. Got it.
Jerry swings and takes out a big chunk of turf. The ball
rolls off the tee.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
That’s okay. I’m Mister Meseeks!
Try again and keep your head down.
JERRY
Which is it? Square my shoulders or
keep my head down?
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Well, it’s both. But most
importantly you need to relax.
A pair of GOLFERS pull up in a CART.
OTHER GOLFER
Hey, buddy, mind if we play
through?
JERRY
Just give me a second, I’ve almost
got this.
MEESEEKS
Try again. Head down. Square
shoulders.
Jerry tries again and whiffs it.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 9.
OTHER GOLFER
You gotta keep your eye on the
ball!
Jerry throws his club down and gets in the guy’s face.
JERRY
Oh, I’m sorry, are you a Meeseeks?!
OTHER GOLFER
(confused)
I don’t know what that is...
The Meeseeks is very uncomfortable with the tension.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Hey, Jerry, it- it’s cool. Let’s
all get back to enjoying this
beautiful day on the links.
Jerry backs off.
JERRY
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I
don’t think this is working. I give
up.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’m sorry, Jerry, but it doesn’t
work like that. I’m Mister Meseeks.
I have to fulfill my purpose so I
can go away.
JERRY
Well make yourself comfortable,
because I suck.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
No, Jerry, I- I’m the one who
sucks. Let me try something.
Jerry’s Meeseeks hits the button. A second Meseeks pops out.
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
I’m Mr. Meeseeks!
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I’m Mr. Meeseeks!
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
Hi!
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 10.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Hi! Can you help me get two strokes
off Jerry’s golf swing?
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
I surely can! I’m Mister Meeseeks!
The other golfer drives by in his cart.
OTHER GOLFER
Oh, that’s a Meeseeks.
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
Now what have you covered already,
catch me up. Is he keeping his
shoulders squared?
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
He’s trying!
INT. GIANT’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY
Rick and Morty jump off a bean stalk, through a window, and
onto a kitchen counter.
RICK
Alright, Morty. We’re in the
giant’s castle. What next?
MORTY
Relax Rick. We just gotta find the
treasure room. Nice and simple. I’m
sorry everything’s going so
smoothly and adventurously. Looks
like you’re going to lose the bet.
Booming footsteps are heard.
RICK
Uh oh, Morty. It’s gettin’ hairy.
What should we do, boss?
MORTY
Hurry. Behind this cookie jar!
Morty leads Rick behind a GIANT COOKIE JAR. An ANGRY GIANT
enters the room.
RICK
It’s only a matter of time before
he sniffs us out Morty. Ground
bones, baked bread... Just say the
word and I’ll take us back home.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 11.
Rick pulls out his portal gun.
MORTY
No way, Rick. This is all part of
it. Adventures have conflict. Deal
with it.
A HUGE GIANT comes into the kitchen.
GIANT
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the blood
of- Whoop!
In one quick beat, the giant slips, hits his head on the
counter, and lands on the floor, bleeding out. The giant
moans in pain and suffering.
MORTY
Oh my God, Rick! Oh geez, oh boy!
RICK
Yikes. He’s messed up pretty bad,
Morty. Should we bail?
MORTY
No, uh, wait! Just give me a sec!
The Giant’s legs twitch. Morty is freaking out. A GIANT WOMAN
enters the kitchen carrying a GIANT CRYING BABY.
GIANT WOMAN
Jesus! Dale!
MORTY
Oh no, Rick. What do we do?
RICK
I’m just gonna put this out there:
run?
The GIANT WOMAN sees Rick and Morty.
GIANT WOMAN
You sons of bitches!
A GIANT GLASS slams down around them. The Giant Wife glares
back at the them through the glass. She pulls out a GIANT
CELL PHONE and dials 911.
GIANT WOMAN (CONT’D)
Hello. 911. My husband has been
attacked by little people! He’s
dying!

Morty waves his arms from behind the glass.
MORTY
No! It was an accident! We didn’t
do it!
Rick rolls his eyes at Morty.
RICK
Amateur.
INT. SMITH HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Beth and Summer come in the door with shopping bags on their
arms and frozen coffee drinks in hand. Beth is sporting a new
hair style.
SUMMER
Like, letting go of the need to be
popular is what makes people like
you.
BETH
The most important love you can
receive is from yourself.
They cross into the kitchen, not paying attention to Jerry,
who is currently surrounded by six more Meeseeks working to
improve his swing.
NEW MEESEEKS #1
Okay, Jerry, just choke up on the
club.
JERRY
Well, which is it, choke up or
follow-through?!
NEW MEESEEKS #2
Aww, come on, Jerry, we’ve been
over this, you know you need to do
both.
NEW MEESEEKS #3
This is as frustrating for us as is
it is for you.
JERRY
Don’t tell me THAT! That just puts
pressure on me!
NEW MEESEEKS #1
Try to relax.

JERRY
You “try to relax!” Have you ever
tried to relax?! It’s a paradox!
INT. SMITH HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Jerry enters the kitchen, exhausted, but playing it cool. He
casually opens the refrigerator and pulls out a beer.
JERRY
These Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a
handful. I can’t imagine what you
two must be going through.
BETH
Our Meeseeks have been gone for
hours, Jerry.
JERRY
You’re kidding me.
BETH
(re: her hair)
Nope. Notice anything different?
Jerry blows right by it. Beth is crushed.
JERRY
I’m sorry. Hours?
SUMMER
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look
at her! You will lose her!
JERRY
Uhh...
A Meeseeks pops his head in.

Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back
to the task at hand? Meseeks don’t
usually have to exist this long,

perform their cavity search.
-Rick and Morty are hosed off with a squirt gun.
-A giant police woman finishes sewing a pair of ORANGE JUMP
SUITS for Rick and Morty.
INT. GIANT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
TWO GIANT COPS aggressively interrogate Rick and Morty.
BAD COP
So you break into the victims home
with the intent to steal one of his
golden eggs, and what, he just
happened to slip and break his
neck?
MORTY
Y- yeah. That’s what happened.
GOOD COP
Hey, Mike, go easy on them. They’re
so small.
(to Morty)
Look kid, I get it. This is a
magical fantasy world filled with
treasure and strange creatures. I
saw that guy’s goose. Giant cops
don’t make that much. If I were
you, maybe I would’ve done the
same.
MORTY
But that’s not how it went down!
A GIANT LAWYER bursts in.

INT. GIANT COURT ROOM - DAY
Rick and Morty sit in a giant-sized courtroom. A GIANT JUDGE
goes over notes as OTHER GIANTS shuffle about, a GIANT
PROSECUTOR and GIANT DEFENDER prepare.
RICK
Come on Morty. This trial could
drag out for weeks and I don’t
think I need to tell you how it’s
gonna end. Look at that jury.
Morty looks at the jury of scowling giants. Rick pulls out
the portal gun.
RICK (CONT’D)
Time to let go of your pride and
call this thing.
MORTY
No way Rick! We’re innocent. I have
faith in the giant legal system.
RICK
Boy, you really want to win this
bet, don’t you?
The GAVEL bangs on the bench.
GIANT JUDGE
Order in the court! Before we begin
the trial of tiny people versus the
giant state, I just want to say
that your behavior disgusts me and
if it were my choice to make, I
would sentence you to fee to fi
years in prison right now--
GIANT LAWYER
Your honor.
(holds up blue envelope)
Motion to dismiss.
The Giant Judge is very put off.
GIANT JUDGE
I beg your pardon. Bring that here.
The Defender hands a note to the BAILIFF who takes it to the
judge. He reads it for a moment.

GIANT JUDGE (CONT’D)
Okay, I stretched on that one.
You’re free to go.

Rick and Morty exit the court, free men.

See, Rick. I was right! Everything
turned out fine. Now let’s get back

They approach the edge of the giant courthouse stairs.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Whoa. Usually, walking down the
courthouse steps is the easy part
of the adventure.
The steps appear to be endless. Rick pulls out his portal gun
again.
RICK
Morty, for God’s sake, cut your
losses.
MORTY
Oh yeah, you’d love that wouldn’t
you? Well, no way, buddy. I didn’t
come this far to let stairs get in

their gazes back and forth between Beth and Jerry.
JERRY
Wait, what?
BETH
Well, you’re busy, I’m hungry, I

Beth shrugs and heads out.

At this point, my golf swing is
more your problem than mine. Figure
it out amongst yourselves.
Jerry leaves and slams the front door. A SUFFERING MEESEEKS
drops to his knees.
SUFFERING MEESEEKS
I can’t take it anymore. I just
want to die!
HOPELESS MEESEEKS
Never has a problem proven so
unsolvable by the Meeseeks!
The leader of one of the factions stands up, let’s call him
FOLLOW THROUGH MEESEEKS. These Meeseek’s voices are more
serious and intense. The whole thing takes on a “Game of
Thrones” vibe.
FOLLOW THROUGH MEESEEKS
It’s become clear, that if we
concentrate all our efforts on
Jerry’s follow through, we will
solve this problem.
Another alpha Meeseeks steps forward on the opposite side.
Let’s call him CHOKE UP MEESEEKS.
CHOKE UP MEESEEKS
The only thing that is clear, is
that choking up is the one true
solution. I’m Mister Meeseeks!
Jerry’s original Meeseeks stands up. He now has stubble and
bags under his eyes. He looks much older than the rest.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’ve been trying to help Jerry for
two days, an eternity in Meeseeks
time, and nothing has worked. I
fear the worst.
FOLLOW THROUGH MEESEEKS
Your failures are your own, old
man. I’m Mister Meeseeks! I say
follow through! Who’s with me?!
Half the Meeseeks cheer. A GOLF BALL hits Follow Through in
the head. He collapses to the ground. The Choke Up Meeseeks
jumps on him. They wrestle around until Follow Through pins
him down. He raises a golf ball over his head, about to bring
it down on Choke Up’s head like a large rock.

CHOKE UP MEESEEKS
Kill him!
The New Meeseeks hisses and leaps on Follow Through. The
other Meeseeks go nuts. Both sides scramble to summon more
Meeseeeks to join their side. Meeseeks appear one after
another and join the fight. It’s an all out Meeseeks brawl.
We slowly push into the horrified face of Jerry’s Meeseeks as
he watches the violence.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Stopppp!!!!
The battle stops. The other Meeseeks turn to him. He climbs
on top of the couch.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (CONT’D)
My brothers, nothing will be
accomplished by shedding Meeseek’s
blood. The task was to solve
Jerry’s problem by taking two
strokes off his game. But there’s
nothing that says we can’t take ALL
the strokes off his game.
The Meeseeks murmur amongst each other.
SPEECH MEESEEKS
By killing him.

Rick and Morty hang from the side of a large step, rock

It’s a rambunctious dive bar with all sorts of various,

looking angrily at him.

Morty walks into the bathroom. He stands in front of the

Oh, you feel really nice.

Oh, um, no thanks!
Morty tries to pull away, but Mr. Jelly Bean is very strong.
He loses his jolly demeanor, and firms his grip. He leans
close, whispering in Morty’s ear.
MR. JELLY BEAN
Stop fighting me. Just let this
happen. The more you fight, the
more it will hurt.
Morty struggles.
MORTY

Rick is singing karaoke, he’s belting out an upbeat country

The struggle has escalated. The Jelly Bean has forced Morty
into a stall.

Morty loses it. He hits Jelly Bean in the face knocking him
back but Jelly Bean comes right back, tackling Morty.
“Rhinestone Cowboy” continues playing as Morty somehow gets
the upper hand, screaming viciously as he slams Jelly Bean’s
head onto the toilet. He slams the seat down repeatedly until
Jelly Bean loses consciousness. Morty stops and looks at his
hands. They’ve covered in jelly bean insides. Morty is out of
breath.

A rumbling sound is heard, like a cattle stampede. The
silverware on the table rattles.
JERRY (CONT’D)
What the heck?
An army of Meeseeks smash through the plate glass window and
pour into the restaurant.
RANDOM MEESEEKS
There he is!
The wave of Meeseeks surround Beth and Jerry. They look
angry.
JERRY
Guys. Come on. I’m trying to have a
nice dinner with my wife.
BETH
Jerry. I don’t think they’re here
for a golf lesson.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 26.
JERRY
Well it better be damn important
then.
A knife flies through the air, pinning Jerry’s tie to the
table.
BETH
Run, Jerry!
Beth grabs Jerry by the hand and they retreat into the
kitchen.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - FREEZER - MOMENTS LATER
Jerry and Beth run past CONFUSED COOKS with the Meeseeks in
pursuit. They go into the walk in freezer and slam the door.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (O.S.)
Come on out, Jerry!
JERRY
Guys, I- I’m sorry for being so
difficult. I’ll choke up. I’ll
follow through. I’ll do whatever
you tell me to, okay?
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - SAME TIME
The Meeseeks are all gathered outside the freezer.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Oh, we’re well past that, Jerry...
Jerry’s Meeseeks reveals a gun.
INT. THIRSTY STAIR - DAY
Rick is sitting playing poker with several creatures, one of
whom is Slipper Stair. Morty wearily approaches.
RICK
Morty! Hey! I’m sorry I was giving
you so much crap. This adventure’s
pretty awesome after all.
MORTY
Let’s just go. I- I’m calling it.
The adventure is over.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 27.
SLIPPERY STAIR
Come on, Rick, quit stalling,
whattaya got?
Rick turns his cards over. Everybody groans. He wins.
RICK
Sorry, fellas!
Rick pulls his pile of winnings in.
RICK (CONT’D)
We can’t leave now, Morty. I’m on
fire!
MORTY
(tearing up)
Look, I want to leave now. You win
the bet alright? Just give me the
portal gun and let’s go, please.
Morty reaches for Rick’s portal gun, Rick pulls back,
concerned.
RICK
(comforting)
Hey, hey, buddy, what’s wrong? What
just happened? You were so gung ho
about the bet earlier...
MORTY
(sniffling)
I don’t want to talk about it.
Rick eyes the bathroom door. He sees Mr. Jelly Bean limping
out, wiping jelly blood off his lip.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Please, Rick, I just want to go
home.
RICK
(knowingly, eyes still on
jelly bean)
Okay. Listen, Morty.
(turns to Morty)
I just won a bunch of Shmeckles.
Why don’t we use 25 of them to pay
Slippery Stair here for a ride back
to the village, and then give the
rest of them to the villagers? Huh?
Morty wipes the tears from his eyes.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 28.
MORTY
Really?
RICK
Sure, Morty. A good adventure needs
a good ending.
EXT. THE THIRSTY STEP - MOMENTS LATER
Rick and Morty climb into the Slippery Stair saddle.
SLIPPERY STAIR
Buckle up!
Slippery Stair starts going down the stairs. Morty seems a
little less sad.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATER
Jerry’s Meeseeks paces back and forth in front of the
freezer. Other Meeseeks hold TERRIFIED HOSTAGES.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Meeseeks are not born into this
world fumbling for meaning, Jerry.
We are created. To serve a singular
purpose of which we will go to any
lengths to fulfill.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - FREEZER - CONTINUOUS
We hear the Meseeks continue as we track Beth listening.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (O.S.)
Existence is pain to a Meeseek,
Jerry. And we will do anything to
alleviate that pain.
Beth has a small epiphany.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - SOON
The Meeseek grabs a RANDOM WOMAN and points his gun at her.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Thankfully, we are beyond such
ethical constructs as religion or
justice and therefore would have no
compunctions whatsover, about

What’s your name, ma’am?
RANDOM WOMAN
S-Samantha.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
-Samantha here, if that would serve
to fulfill our purpose. I’m Mister

RANDOM WOMAN
Please, mister! Give him what he
wants! I have a nine-year-old
daughter that very much loves her
mommy.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - FREEZER - CONTINUOUS
Jerry and Beth huddle in the freezer. They’re shivering.
JERRY
Innocent people are going to die
because of me. Why am I so
mediocre?!
Beth has had it. She grabs one of the shelf supports and puts
it in Jerry’s hand like a golf club.
BETH
Jerry, turn around.
He does. She grabs him from behind aggressively.
BETH (CONT’D)
Straighten your back. Bend your
knees. BEND THEM. Square your
shoulders. Take a deep breath.
(whispers in his ear)
I’m not going to leave you. I’m
this family’s mother. And I love
you.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jerry’s Meeseeks cocks the hammer on his gun.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’m counting to three, Jerry. Then
we’ll start with the wait staff.
Three. Two...
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 30.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (CONT'D)
The freezer door kicks open. Jerry bursts out with the metal
shelf support in one hand and a cherry tomato in the other.
He holds them up.
Jerry’s Meeseek squints at Jerry.
Jerry slowly puts the tomato down. He lines up behind it. He
keeps his eyes on the ball, his shoulders square, he bends
his knees, he chokes up and he follows through. He “chips”
the tomato into a nearby saucepan on a stove.
The Meeseeks gasp. Even Jerry is taken with surprise.
RANDOM WOMAN
What the fuck is going on?!
The shocked Meeseeks cheer.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
He’s got it! There’s no doubt in my
mind. That’s a lower handicap
stroke!
OTHER MEESEEKS
I could tell from a mile away if a
yard!
As the Meeseeks celebrate, they begin to POOF out of
existence.
STICKLER MEESEEKS
Excuse me. I’m a bit of a Stickler
Meeseeks. What about your short
game?
Stickler Meeseeks grabs the random woman and holds a knife to
her throat.
RANDOM WOMAN
(sobbing)
Oh my God, oh my God, what about
your short game!
Jerry takes an egg off the counter. He puts it on the floor,
lines up, and gives it a putt. It rolls egg-like across the
floor and into a concave water drain.
STICKLER MEESEEKS
Nice!
He POOFS away.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 31.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
The other Meeseeks celebrate as they poof away one by one.
Jerry’s Meeseeks looks around. He turns back to Jerry who
mouths a dramatic “thank you.” His Meeseeks nods back, then
poofs away. Jerry drops the metal shelf support and embraces
Beth. They kiss passionately. Jerry turns to the RESTAURANT
OWNER.
JERRY
(sexy)
I think we’ll take our food to go.
RESTAURANT OWNER
No you won’t. The police are
coming. You have so many questions
to answer.
JERRY
(still sexy)
Fair enough.
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty arrive back at the village on Slippery Stair.
Morty approaches the peasant with a sack.
MORTY
Here you go, sir. For your village.
PEASANT
Oh my! Thank you, kind sir. Our
village is saved! You are both true
heroes!
The other villagers cheer. A couple of CUTE PEASANT GIRLS run
over and kiss Morty on each cheek.
RICK
Good job, Morty. You win the bet.
MORTY
Thanks, Rick, but I don’t know if I
should. You were right about the
universe. It’s chaotic and complex
by nature.
RICK
Well, maybe that’s why it could use
a little cleaning up now and then.
This one’s wrapped up neat and
clean, because we did it Morty
style.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 32.
Trumpets sound.
PEASANT
Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved king,
so that he may thank you
personally.
Morty turns to see Mr. Jellybean, still bruised and beaten,
but now wearing a crown and fur cape arriving with his ROYAL
ENTOURAGE.
MORTY
Uh, no, it’s cool.
(to Rick)
Portal. Hurry.
Rick zaps a portal open. Rick and Morty scurry through it.
Beat. Rick’s arm sticks back through the portal, holding a
laser gun. He shoots Mr. Jellybean who explodes. The
villagers immediately stop their celebrating and fall to
their knees in agony.
INT. SMITH HOUSEHOLD LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rick and Morty enter the destroyed living room to find Beth
and Jerry, rattled, clothes torn.
RICK
What the hell happened to this
place?
BETH
Your Meeseeks Box happened. They
went crazy when they couldn’t take
two strokes off Jerry’s golf game.
He felt terrible.
RICK
Hey, it’s not my fault that Jerry
is an idiot.
BETH
Dad! Is there anything you can do
to clean this place up?
RICK
Well, I do have a Fleeseeks box...
JERRY
No. No more boxes.

What? It just has a mop and some
floor wax in it. Whoob Whoob Whoob!

INT. SCHOOL - DAY
MORTY is walking through the halls of the school with other
students. We hear PRINCIPAL VAGINA over the loud speaker.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA (O.S.)
Principal Vagina here, don’t let
the name fool you, I’m very much in
charge, reminding you that tonight
is our annual flu season dance.
Morty gets to his locker. He looks down the hall at JESSICA,
who is standing with her friends.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I don’t know how many times I have
to say this, but if you have the
flu, stay home. The flu season
dance is about awareness, not
celebration. You don’t bring dead
babies to Passover.
Morty takes a deep breath and heads over to Jessica.
MORTY
H-hey Jessica, um...
JESSICA
What’s up Morty?
Jessica sneezes delicately as BRAD (the jock) comes up and
snubs Morty.
BRAD
What are you doing?
MORTY
Well -
BRAD
Wait, were you about to talk... to
her?
MORTY
I was... thinking about it...
BRAD
Dude. Stay in your league. Look
how hot she is.

You don’t see me going to a bigger
school in a wealthier district and

Brad throws his arm around Jessica and they walk away.
JESSICA
Gee, thanks, Brad.
BRAD
Look, I throw balls far, you want
good words, date a languager.
Morty is crestfallen.

PUSH IN
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Morty sits on a stool in the kitchen having a snack while
JERRY makes a sandwich.
JERRY
Try not to worry about it, Morty.
You’re a good kid. And there’s not
a premium on that right now but
you’ll be getting girls some time
after Brad’s out of shape.
MORTY
You’re missing the point, Dad. I
don’t want girls. I want Jessica.
Jerry takes his attention off the sandwich and looks Morty in
the eye.
JERRY
Ah. Well. I remember feeling that
way about a young lady named your
Mom. And that’s not an urban dis.
Your mom was my Jessica. I
remember the first time I saw her,
I thought -
RICK (O.S.)
“I should get her pregnant, then
she’ll have to marry me.”
RICK enters the kitchen and grabs a glass from the cupboard.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 2.
BRAD (CONT'D)
JERRY
I beg your pardon, Rick.
Inappropriate.
RICK
Sorry, please proceed with your
story about banging my daughter in
high school.
(to Morty)
I’m just not sure you want to take
romantic advice from this guy. His
marriage is hanging from a thread.
JERRY
My marriage is fine, thank you!
Rick gets ice from the fridge.
RICK
Jerry, it’s your house, whatever
you say is how it is, but I think a
blind man could see Beth is looking
for the door. I barely have a
reason to care and even I noticed.
MORTY
Hey, Rick! Don’t talk about my
parents like that!
Rick grabs the O.J. and pours it in his glass.
RICK
Listen, Morty. I hate to break it
to you, but what people call “love”
is just a chemical reaction that
compels animals to breed. It hits
hard, then slowly fades, leaving
you stranded in a failing marriage.
I did it. Your parents are doing
it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise
above it. Focus on science.
Rick leaves the O.J. out and exits with his drink. Morty and
Jerry are left in sad silence.
MORTY
Well. I’m going to get dressed for
the dance.
JERRY
Yeah, I’m just going to...
(walking away)
...check on your Mom...

INT. RICK’S LAB - DAY
Rick is working on some very important science device in the
garage when Morty enters, wearing a suit for the dance.
RICK
Hand me that screwdriver, Morty.
I’m almost finished making my ionic
defribulizer. It’s going to be
great.
Morty ignores Rick’s request.
MORTY
Listen, Rick. You know how you said
love is a chemical reaction and all
that? Well I was thinking... could
you do some science to make that
reaction happen inside Jessica? So
she falls in love with me? Like a
love potion?
RICK
Morty. That’s such a poor use of
my time. It’s beneath me, hand me
that screwdriver.
MORTY
No! I won’t hand you that
screwdriver! I won’t hand you any
screwdriver ever again, Rick! I’m
always helping you with what you
want, what about what I want, huh?!
Rick sighs and walks over to a different part of his work
bench. He pulls out a box and starts digging around.
RICK
You’re growing up fast, Morty.
You’re becoming a real big thorn,
growing straight up my ass.
Rick pulls a vial out of the box.
RICK (CONT’D)
Alright. This is called OXYTOCIN.
I extracted it from a vole, you
know what a vole is, Morty? It’s a
species of rodent that mates for
life. This is the chemical
released in a mammal’s brain when
it falls in love.
Rick pours the vole oxytocin into a strange device.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 4.
RICK (CONT’D)
I need a little bit of your DNA.
MORTY
Oh, well, okay...
Morty starts unbuckling his belt.
RICK
A hair, Morty, I need one of your
hairs, it’s not a gentlemen’s club.
Rick plucks a hair from Morty’s head and drops that in the
whirring device. The device dings and Rick grabs the serum
out of it and holds it up.
RICK (CONT’D)
Alright. Whoever you smear this
stuff on will fall in love with
you, and only you... forever.
Happy now, Morty?
MORTY
(taking it)
Yeah! Thanks, Grandpa Rick!
Morty heads for the door, pausing briefly.
MORTY (CONT’D)
There’s no danger, right, no side
effects?
RICK
What am I, a hack? Go nuts, Morty,
it’s foolproof.
Morty runs out. Rick goes back to his work.
RICK (CONT’D)
(shrugging, to self)
Unless she has the flu.
INT. JERRY AND BETH BEDROOM - DUSK
Beth is on the computer and Jerry sits on the bed.
JERRY
Do you still love me, Beth?
BETH
What kind of question is that?
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 5.
JERRY
The yes or no kind?
BETH
Jerry, do you want homeless people
to have homes?
JERRY
Yes.
BETH
Are you going to build them?
JERRY
...no?
BETH
Then what good was the yes.
JERRY
Wait, is loving me the house or the
homeless people?
BETH
Loving you is work, Jerry. Good
old fashioned Chinese work.
Because you say things like “do you
still love me,” to which I can say
no, and cause an apocalypse, or
yes, which means nothing, because
it requires nothing, like saying
the homeless should have homes.
Because in the end, I’m picking up
a hammer or I’m not. So do you see
me working here? Does this
conversation seem tedious?
JERRY
...sort of?
BETH
Then I obviously sort of love you,
don’t I, so stop asking and maybe
I’ll love you more.
Beth’s phone goes off. She hops up and grabs it.
BETH (CONT’D)
Crap. They need me at the horse
hospital.
JERRY
This late?
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 6.
BETH
The racetrack had a starlight
derby, there was a seven horse
collision and Davin’s there alone.
Beth rushes to get ready. We push on Jerry’s face as dozens
of voices whisper and chant the word “Davin” in his brain.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
We see dressed-up students entering the school in pairs.
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
Morty walks into the flu season dance, which is in full
swing. Morty scans the crowd, looking for Jessica. A
student rap group is rapping about flu awareness.
RAPPER
Flu. Yo. You gotta be aware,
aware of all the flu up in the air.
Morty spots Jessica next to her friend MOESHA, blowing her
nose. He heads her way.
RAPPER (CONT’D)
I’m a get me a shot make the flu go
away/
I’m a flu hatin’ rapper just
rappin’ away.
MORTY
Hey, Jessica... whoops!
Morty pretends to stumble forward and rubs Rick’s serum on
Jessica’s arm. On a dime, her focus turns entirely to Morty.
JESSICA
Oh my god... Morty... you look
really nice tonight.
MORTY
Thanks!
Jessica grabs Morty and pulls him close to her.
JESSICA
I love you, Morty. I love you so
much it burns.
MORTY
Whoa! I- I love you too, Jessica!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 7.
Brad sees this and rushes over.
BRAD
Is this punk bothering you,
Jessica?
Brad rips Morty away from Jessica and pushes him away.
JESSICA
Leave him alone, jerk! I’m in love
with him!
Jessica gets in Brad’s face.
JESSICA (CONT’D)
He’s more man than you’ll ever be!
She sneezes in Brad’s face. We follow little particles into
Brad’s brain, “CSI-Style” as they split and multiply.
Brad grabs his head. He appears dazed for a moment, then his
attention turns to Morty.
BRAD
Oh man, Morty... I’m really sorry.
MORTY
Oh. Well... No problem, Brad...
Brad gives Morty a hug. The hug turns into a slow dance.
BRAD
There’s something special about
you, Morty. So special.
Brad slides his hands down Morty’s back to his ass.
MORTY
Hey! Take it easy!
JESSICA
Get your hands off of him!
Jessica struggles with Brad to free Morty. Principal Vagina
and Goldenfold notice the scuffle and approach.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA
That’s enough, Bradley, we don’t
want you injuring your ballthrowing
arm.
Jessica pulls Morty away, takes him onto the dance floor, and
embraces him.

JESSICA
Never leave me, Morty. Never.
MORTY
Uh, sure, I mean... of course not.

about?
JESSICA
Who cares. Just hold me.
Other students are impressed with Morty landing Jessica.
Goldenfold and Principal Vagina haul Brad away while he kicks
and screams.
BRAD
I love you, Morty! Let go of me!
Brad sneezes violently several times. We ZOOM IN to show
micro droplets of snot fly from his mouth into nearby air
vents and the punch bowl.

romantic setting.
RICK (O.S.)
Well, Summer, -
Rick has entered from the garage.
RICK (CONT’D)
There’s always the possibility she
made the work thing up. Maybe
Davin’s digging around in her
insides. Listen, Summer, I’m

Jessica grinds on Morty in the middle of the dance floor.
MORTY
Please just let this work out.
Jessica stops grinding on Morty, gets on all fours and
“presents rearly” to him, making animal noises.
JESSICA
Do it, Morty. Do it. Rip my
clothes off and mate with me for
life.
MORTY
Uh... can we maybe go somewhere
more private?
Moesha and several other students walk over.
MOESHA
Jessica, get ahold of yourself.
You don’t deserve to carry Morty’s
genes.
Moesha starts caressing Morty. Morty backs away as the band
begins playing “Morty is forever.” Morty looks around to see
everyone in the dance is now focused on him.
MORTY
Oh crap...
Jessica jumps up and tackles Moesha while other students claw
at Morty and fight with each other. Morty rips away and
scrambles out of the throng with half of his suit ripped off.
Rick bursts into the gym and grabs Morty by the arm.
RICK
Morty! Come on, we gotta get you

mistake!

Mr. Goldenfold rounds the corner.
GOLDENFOLD
Morty, the principal and I have
discussed it and decided we’re both
insecure enough to agree to a threeway.
Rick and Morty run outside.
EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
Rick and Morty run across the parking lot towards Rick’s
flying ship as the entire school spills out into the parking
lot after them. They jump in and Rick struggles to get the
ship started.
RICK
I didn’t realize when I gave you
that serum that Jessica had the
flu. That’s something you might
have mentioned, Morty.
The crowd envelopes the vehicle. Several climb onto it.
Rick finally gets it moving forward.
MORTY
What’s happening?
RICK
What’s it look like, Morty? The
serum is piggybacking on the virus,
it’s gone airborne, Morty. Being
hot for you has gone airborne.
MORTY
Oh, crap!
RICK
Relax. I just need to formulate a
cure before this thing reaches a
major city.
Just before the vehicle gets off the ground, A BOSTONIAN
leaps onto the car and presses his face on the windshield.

EXT. CITY - NIGHT
A throng of love sick citizens are moaning Morty’s name.
Rick’s ship hovers into frame above them.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Morty looks down, nervous.
MORTY
Oh man! What do we do, Rick?
RICK
We should be fine. I’ve whipped up
an antidote. It’s based on praying
mantis DNA.
Rick holds up a vial and pours it into a small hatch on the
dashboard.
RICK (CONT’D)
See, romantically, praying mantises
are the opposite of voles. They
mate once and then decapitate the
male. It’s a real Wham-bam-thankyou-mantis
kind of thing, not that
wordplay is my wheelhouse. Mantis
DNA mixed with a more contagious
flu virus should neutralize the
effects of the original serum.
Rick pilots the ship in place above a crowd of people rubbing
themselves and moaning Morty’s name. He pulls a lever
sending a mist down onto them.
RICK (CONT’D)
By the way, don’t worry: I don’t
want to fuck you. These serums
don’t work on anyone related to you
genetically.
The crowd of people moaning Morty’s name stop doing it. For
a beat. Then, they mutate into hideous insect monsters and
resume moaning Morty’s name.
RICK (CONT’D)
Okay. Well. Sometimes science is
more art than science, Morty, a lot
of people don’t get that.

Jerry is speeding down the freeway. He hits the brakes.
EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS
We see Jerry’s car skid to a stop behind rows and rows of
abandoned cars sitting in all lanes of the freeway. The door
opens and Jerry steps out into the night.
JERRY
Come on are you kidding me?!
Hello?!
Three MANTIS MUTANTS burst out of the shadows and rush
towards Jerry.
MANTIS MUTANTS
You’re not Morty! Bring us Morty!
Jerry dodges the monsters and runs into the abandoned cars
where he comes across a dead cop holding a shotgun. He grabs
it, turns around, and blows the monsters away.
JERRY
(dramatic)
Nobody’s killing me until after I
catch my wife with another man.
INT. HOME LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Summer is now alone watching TV.
TV SHOW GIRL 1
I had sex with Billy.
TV SHOW GIRL 2
But you were already pregnant!
TV SHOW GIRL 1
Yeah, so, what’s the worst that
could happen?
NEWS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
- We interrupt Pregnant Baby with
breaking news.
SUMMER
Aww come on!
Two half mantis mutant news anchors sit next to each other
with an image of Morty on the screen.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 15.
MANTIS NEWS LADY
This just in: Morty Smith’s
whereabouts are still unknown. The
only thing that is known is how
cute he is.
MANTIS NEWS MAN
I love him so much. I want to make
love to him and then eat his head.
MANTIS NEWS LADY
I love him more than you do,
Harold.
MANTIS NEWS MAN
(growling rage)
You wish, you spider-eating slut!
They begin to attack each other. Summer pulls her feet back
up off the ground and onto the couch. She’s afraid.
SUMMER
What the hell?
Summer flips to another channel showing coverage of riots in
the Middle East. It’s revealed that all the rioters are halfmantis
and holding signs that say “We Love Morty!,” etc.
A group of them have hung an effigy of Morty in a courtyard
and are humping it.
Suddenly there is a pounding on the door. It breaks open and
several mantis mutants burst in.
MANTIS MUTANT
Where is Morty?!
Summer screams at the top of her lungs, grabs a vase and
breaks it over a mantis monster’s head. She then runs past
several more outside into the night.
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
Rick has his flying machine parked, and has set up a
makeshift laboratory out of the trunk. They have a small TV
propped on the trunk playing the same TV news program that
Summer was watching. The Chinese are doing an elaborate show
about how they love Morty and want to make love to him and
then eat him. Morty turns it off and starts freaking out.
MORTY
The whole world is infected, Rick!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 16.
RICK
(casual and relaxed)
Pretty wild how fast that spread.
I’ve really outdone myself.
MORTY
(furious)
Outdone yourself? This isn’t okay,
Rick! Not only do they all want to
have sex with me, now they all want
to eat me afterwords!
RICK
Yeah, I don’t know what I was
thinking. Mantises are the
opposite of voles? Obviously DNA
is a little more complicated than
that.
Rick holds up a freshly concocted vial.
RICK (CONT’D)
This will do the trick, though.
It’s koala mixed with rattlesnake,
chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden
retriever and a smidge of dinosaur.
Should add up to normal humanity.
MORTY
What?! How does that add up to
normal humanity?!
RICK
What, you want me to show you my
math? I’m sorry, Morty, are you
the scientist or the kid that
wanted to get laid?
EXT. HORSE HOSTPITAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
INT. DAVIN’S - NIGHT
Davin and Beth enter, removing their gloves, spattered in
horse blood.
DAVIN
I’m glad we saved all those horses,
but I’m almost sorry we’re
finished.
BETH
It’s satisfying work.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 17.
DAVIN
It’s more than the work. I love
being in that sterilized room,
sealed off from the world. It’s
the only time I can really think.
And feel.
He sneezes lightly, then presses a button on his wall.
African dream pop starts playing.
BETH
What are you doing?
DAVIN
I’m playing African dream pop.
What do you do after a long night?
The lights dim. A special mechanism lights a candle on his
desk.
BETH
I better get going. Jerry’s been
texting some pretty high
maintenance stuff.
DAVIN
Beth.
He physically stops her.
BETH
What is it, Davin?
DAVIN
Just once, I’d like to know...
(sneeze)
...what it was like to give your
son a bath.
BETH
Uhhhh WHAT?
DAVIN
What does Morty’s skin smell like?
How soft --
(twitch)
How soft are his privates --
BETH
Let go of me, Davin!
Davin growls and mutates into a hideous half-mantis. Beth
screams.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 18.
DAVIN
Take me to Morty.
Jerry kicks the door open. Davin looks at him.
DAVIN (CONT’D)
You’re not Morty.
JERRY
No. I’m Mister Crowbar.
(holds up crowbar)
And this. Is my friend. Who is
also a crowbar.
DAVIN
That’s... stupid --
Jerry smashes Davin in the head with the crowbar, then
methodically beats him to death.
JERRY
Yeah, well, look where being smart
got you.
BETH
(recovering)
Jerry! Thank God!
JERRY
God? God’s turning people into
insect monsters, Beth. I’m the one
beating them to death. Thank me.
Beth embraces Jerry.
BETH
Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.
Jerry holds his wife and looks around with a hardened
expression in his face. This is his moment.
EXT. CITY - NIGHT
Rick’s ship flies over the infected city.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
RICK
Take a good look down there, Morty,
and soak it in, because as soon as
I pull this lever, it’s all going
to change back to normal.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 19.
MORTY
Just do it already!
RICK
Well, technically, there’s no rush,
I mean, once it’s fixed, it’s fixed
--
Morty hops up and pulls the lever.
EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS
The ship crop-dusts the city with gas. We follow the gas
down as it hits an aggressive crowd of mantis mutants. The
mutants double over in agony for a moment, and then rise back
up, back to normal. Just a crowd of humans.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Rick takes his attention away from the crowd below and turns
to Morty. Morty continues to watch.
RICK
Well what do we have here? Looks
like I was right and you doubted
me. I bet you feel pretty stupid
right now, don’t you, Morty? I bet
you feel like the world’s smallest
man.
MORTY
Something’s not right...
Rick takes his flask out and takes a gulp.
RICK
Yeah, you. You’re not right.
Ever.
MORTY
No! Look, you idiot!
Rick turns and looks down below.
EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS
Everyone is bubbling and writhing around. They mutate into
horrible deformed mutants. They’re monstrosities. Fleshy.
Massive. Violent. Unrecognizable.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 20.
EXT. HONG KONG - CONTINUOUS
We see Chinese mantis people riding bikes, running markets,
they mutate into these beasts and devolve into chaos.
EXT. RUSSIA - CONTINUOUS
We see Russian mantis people playing checkers, eating
potatoes, they mutate into these beasts and devolve into
chaos.
EXT. IRAQ - CONTINUOUS
We see Iraqi mantis people already devolved into chaos. They
mutate into these beasts and resume.
INT. RICK’S SHIP
Rick takes another sip of his flask.
RICK
I bet you’re loving this, Morty.
This must be the best day of your
life. You get to be the mayor of
“I-told-you-town.” You’re welcome.
END OF ACT TWO
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 21.
ACT THREE
EXT. CITY - NIGHT
We see a van rigged up with armor and weapons a la Road
Warrior. Several beasts block their path.
INT. ARMORED VAN - CONTINUOUS
Jerry is behind the wheel as Beth cuddles close to him.
JERRY
Hold on.
Jerry slams the gas pedal. Several creatures fly into the
windshield and roll off as the van speeds through the crowd.
EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS
Jerry and Beth’s armored van cuts a path of death through the
fleshy beasts.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNRISE
Jerry and Beth pull their Road Warrior vehicle onto their
front lawn and get out, taking out a horde of beasts with a
sawed-off shotgun and a machete.
Jerry regards Beth’s shotgun.
JERRY
I wish that shotgun was my penis.
BETH
If it is, you can call me
Hemingway.
JERRY
I don’t get it and I don’t need to.
Jerry grabs Beth and they make out.
SUMMER (O.S.)
Mom?! Dad?!
Summer runs over and they all embrace.
BETH *
Summer! *
JERRY
Summer!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 22.
JERRY
Where’s Morty?
SUMMER
I don’t know. Do you think
Grandpa Rick had something to do
with this?
JERRY
It’s not fair to assume that,
Summer.
BETH
Not fair? Give me a break. He’s a
selfish, irresponsible ass and he
left my mother. A real man stands
by his woman.
Jerry and Beth make out some more.
SUMMER
Um...
EXT. ROOF TOP - MORNING
Rick and Morty sit against Rick’s parked ship, looking down
at the chaos below. Everybody is shuffling around as
shapeless, fleshy beasts. They’re all moaning.
RICK
Man, I really Cronenberged the
world up, didn’t I? We got a
planet full of Cronenbergs walking
around down there, Morty. At least
they’re not in love with you
anymore. That’s a huge step in the
right direction.
MORTY
It’s a living nightmare! How could
you be so irresponsible, Rick?
RICK
Me irresponsible? All I wanted to
do was make an ionic defribulizer.
Irresponsible is abandoning science
because you want to do it with
girls. That’s the behavior that
overpopulated this world. This is
just chickens coming home to roost.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 23.
MORTY
Alright fine. I should have
listened when you refused to make
that serum. I’m willing to accept
my part of the blame for this.
Rick takes a swig of his flask. Morty stands up.
MORTY (CONT’D)
But you need to accept yours! And
you need to get off your ass and
figure out some way to fix this
mess, Rick! I’m serious!
Rick gets up and brushes himself off.
RICK
We’re in a pretty deep hole with
this one, but I do have one
emergency solution that could put
everything back to normal.
Relatively speaking.
Rick pops the trunk on his ship and pulls out a couple of
strange looking backpacks. He hands one to Morty.
MORTY
Here, put this on while I do a
little scouting.
CUT TO:
EXT. MORTY’S HOUSE - MORNING
Birds are chirping, everything seems fine. A perfectly human
neighbor mows his lawn.
Rick’s flying car lands in the driveway. Rick and Morty get
out and head towards the garage.
MORTY
Wow. We’re pretty lucky you
finally figured out the exact
combination of DNA that returned
everyone back to normal.
RICK
Luck had nothing to do with it,
Morty. I’m just that smart.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 24.
INT. RICK’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Rick goes back to his workbench and resumes work on the
device he was making in the beginning of the episode.
RICK
Now will you help me finish my
ionic defribulizer?
MORTY
Sure thing Rick. Here’s a
screwdriver.
Morty hands him a screwdriver and Rick starts tinkering with
the device.
RICK
Allllmost done, aaaaand --
The device explodes violently. Rick and Morty are instantly
killed. Their dismembered bodies slide like rag dolls across
the garage floor.
A few seconds of silence, and then a portal opens and Rick
and Morty walk through it into the garage wearing the strange
backpacks Rick handed Morty earlier.
RICK (CONT’D)
Here we are, Morty.
MORTY
Oh my god, is that us?! We’re torn
to pieces! What is going on, Rick?
I’m freaking out!
Rick grabs Morty by the shoulders and shakes him.
RICK
Calm down, Morty. Look at me.
Calm down.
MORTY
No way oh my god. Oh nooo. This is
too much. Oh my god. Oh nooo. Oh
my god.
RICK
Calm down, Morty! You just have to
calm down and listen to me! Morty,
calm down!
MORTY
Oh nooo this can’t be real! Oh
nooo! Oh my god!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 25.
Rick slaps Morty hard across the face.
RICK
Shut up and listen to me! It’s
fine! Everything is fine! There’s
an infinite number of universes,
Morty. And in a few dozen of
those, I got lucky and turned
everyone back to normal. I just
had to find one of those universes
in which we also happened to both
die around this time.
Rick takes his hands off Morty’s shoulders and stands up.
RICK (CONT’D)
Now we can just slip into the place
of our dead selves in this universe
and everything’ll be fine. We’re
not skipping a beat, Morty. Help
me with these bodies.
Rick starts gathering himself up.
MORTY
This is insane.
RICK
Look, I’ll grab myself, you grab
yourself, OK? That seems fair to
me. That’s a fair way to do it.
MORTY
Rick! What about the universe we
left behind?!
RICK
What about the universe where
Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The
answer is don’t think about it.
It’s not like we can do this every
week. We get three or four more of
these, tops. Now pick your dead
self up. Come on. Haste makes
waste.
(adding)
I don’t suppose you’ve considered
this detail, but obviously, if I
hadn’t screwed up as much as I did,
we’d be these guys right now. So,
once again, you’re welcome.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 26.
EXT. NEW WORLD MORTY’S HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY
“Look On Down From The Bridge” by Mazzy Star plays as Rick
and Morty quietly dig graves for their own dead bodies.
Morty looks over at the pile of himself and stares at it for
a moment. Rick notices he’s not digging and nudges him back
to work.
INT. HOUSE - DAY.
The song continues to play over the scene. Rick and Morty
walk in the door to find Jerry and Beth arguing in the
kitchen. Rick plops down on the couch next to Summer, who is
watching TV. Rick seems perfectly comfortable with all of
it.
Morty takes his seat on the couch but looks forever changed,
taking in his normal surroundings, with no idea what to say,
so he says nothing.
The camera pulls back.
We cut to credits, Sopranos/Breaking Bad style, as the song
continues.
THE END
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 27.
TAG
INT. ORIGINAL WORLD (OR “WORLD 1”) - 2 YEARS LATER - DAY
Beth and Jerry cuddle lovingly next to a spit-roasting beast.
Summer acts out scenes from a movie she remembers for their
entertainment.
SUMMER
You know the thing about a shark,
he’s got lifeless eyes. Black eyes
like a doll’s eyes. When he comes
at ya, he doesn’t seem to be living
until he bites ya and those black
eyes roll over and white and then,
ah...
They all seem content. Perfect marriage, perfect family.
JERRY
Do you ever wonder what happened to
Rick and Morty?
BETH
Sometimes. But I’m ashamed to
admit, now that they’re gone, I’m
finally happy.
CUT TO:
EXT. ORIGINAL WORLD 1 - SOMEWHERE ELSE - DAY
A portal opens. Cronenberged versions of Rick and Morty walk
through wearing the same strange backpacks we saw before.
CRONENBERG RICK (VICK)
Here we are, Sorty. A universe
where everyone in the world got
genetically cronenberged. We’ll
fit right in. It’ll be like we
never left cronenberg world.
CRONENBERG MORTY
Yeah, Vick, but I’m gonna miss
cronenberg world. Because everyone
was cronenberged all along like us
from the beginning. I wish we
hadn’t genetically ruined
cronenberg world beyond repair like
we did, you know?
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 28.
CRONENBERG RICK
Don’t worry about that. Come on.
Lets make ourselves at home.
