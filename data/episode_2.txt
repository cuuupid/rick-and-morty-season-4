RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT. MORTY’S HOME - DAY
JERRY is on the sofa watching TV. SUMMER is next to him,
texting. Snuffles, the family dog, walks up and looks at
Jerry.
JERRY
(to Snuffles)
What?
(no response)
Why are you looking at me?
(no response)
You want to go outside?
(no response)
Outside?
Jerry gets up, crosses the room and opens the back door. The
dog watches him.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Outside?
No response. Jerry closes the door, crosses back to the sofa
and sits down.
Snuffles raises a leg and pisses on the floor.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Are you KIDDING me?! Come ON!
SUMMER
(still texting)
Oh my God I’m going to die.
Morty runs in.
MORTY
What’s wrong?
JERRY
Your idiot dog!
MORTY
Oh, he didn’t mean it! Did you
Snuffles? You didn’t mean it,
you’re a good boy! Good dog!
JERRY
Don’t praise him now, Morty! He
just pissed on the carpet!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 1.
Jerry shoves the dog’s face into the carpet.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Bad dog. Bad!
Rick walks in, grabs Morty’s arm, and starts dragging him
away.
RICK
Morty, come on. I need your help
tonight.
JERRY
Wait, hold on a second, Rick... You
wouldn’t, by any chance, have some
crazy science thing you could whip
up that might help make this dog
easier to house train would you?
RICK
I thought the whole point of having
a dog was to feel superior, Jerry.
If I were you, I wouldn’t pull that
thread.
(To Morty)
Come on, Morty.
Jerry grabs Morty’s other arm, playing tug of war with Rick.
JERRY
Listen, Rick! If you’re gonna stay
here rent free and use my son for
your stupid science, the least you
could do is put a little bit of it
to use for the family! You make
that dog smart or Morty’s grounded!
MORTY †
Awww, man! †
SUMMER
Haha awesome.
Rick drops Morty’s arm.
RICK
You’ve really got me up against a
wall here, Jerry.
He exits the room. We hear some scientific work from the
garage. Rick comes back in with a helmet device with all
kinds of wires and doo-dads sticking out of it.
He sticks it on the dog’s head and turns it on. Summer puts
her phone down and watches.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 2.
RICK (CONT’D)
Ruffles --
(to Jerry)
What’s his name?
MORTY
Snuffles.
RICK
Snuffles. Shake.
Snuffles sits up and shakes.
RICK (CONT’D)
Roll over.
Snuffles rolls over.
RICK (CONT’D)
Go to the bathroom.
Snuffles walks away.
We wait a beat and hear the toilet flush. Snuffles returns.
JERRY
Holy crap!
SUMMER †
No way! †
RICK (CONT’D)
Yeah, you’re at the top of your
game, now, Jerry. Have fun.
(To Morty)
Come on, Morty.
Rick grabs Morty’s arm and drags him out of the room. Summer
and Jerry rush over to the Dog.
INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty enter.
MORTY
That was fantastic, Rick!
RICK
If you like that, Morty, you’re
gonna love this.
Rick turns his head to reveal a SMALL DEVICE sticking out of
his ear. It looks like a high tech blue tooth ear piece.
MORTY
What is it?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 3.
RICK
It’s a device that will allow us to
enter people’s dreams, Morty. Just
like in that movie you never shut
the fuck up about.
MORTY
Inception?
RICK
That’s right. This is gonna be
like that except it’s gonna make
sense.
MORTY
Inception made sense...
RICK
You don’t have to try to impress
me, Morty. Tonight we’re going to
the home of your math teacher,
Mister Goldenfold, and we’re going
to use this bad boy to enter his
dreams and convince him to give you
less homework. That way, you’ll
have more time to help me with my
science.
MORTY
Geez, Rick, in the time it took you
to make this, couldn’t you have
just helped me with my homework?
RICK
Are you listening, Morty? Homework
is stupid, the whole point is to
get less of it. Not very bright,
are you? No wonder you’re doing
bad in school. Now let’s get over
to your teacher’s house and make
with some incepting.
INT. GOLDENFOLD’S LIVING ROOM - DUSK
Mr. Goldenfold lies on his couch. ON TV we see Jada Pinkett
having a very serious conversation with a HANDSOME BLACK MAN.
JADA PINKET
You don’t know me.
HANDSOME BLACK MAN
Then let me get to know you, damn
it!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 4.
Goldenfold is snacking on a box of WHEAT THINS.
GOLDENFOLD
(sleepy)
Not today, Darius. Not today.
He passes out and starts to snore. Rick and Morty climb in
through the window with the dream inceptors. Rick puts a
device in Goldenfold’s ear and two similar ones in his and
Morty’s ears. Rick notices the TV. Jada Pinkett is making
out with the handsome black man.
RICK
Uh oh. Spoilers!
Rick quickly turns the TV off.
RICK (CONT’D)
I’m a full season behind on Jada
Pinkett’s You Don’t Know Me.
MORTY
I can’t believe I’m in Mr.
Goldenfold’s house. This is so
weird.
RICK
It’s about to get a whole lot
weirder, Morty.
He turns a dial on Morty’s bluetooth, Morty falls asleep in
an awkward heap on the floor. Rick positions himself next to
Goldenfold on the couch and turns his own bluetooth dial,
falling asleep in comfort.
INT. AIRPLANE (GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM) - CONTINUOUS
Jada Pinkett is a sexy stewardess walking down the aisle
handing out Wheat Thins to PASSENGERS.
JADA PINKET
Wheat Thins. Wheat Thins.
GOLDENFOLD
I’ll take two.
JADA PINKET
(flirty)
I think you’ve had enough, sir.
GOLDENFOLD
You don’t know me.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 5.
They laugh flirtatiously with each other. ANGLE ON Rick and
Morty, a few rows back.
RICK
Alright, Morty, time to make our
move.
Rick grabs some bottles and napkins from the nearby drink
cart, and hands one to Morty.
RICK (CONT’D)
Wrap this around your head. We’re
about to take Goldenfold’s
subconscious hostage.
MOMENTS LATER
Jada Pinkett is sitting on Goldenfold’s lap, feeding him
Wheat Thins and giggling. Rick and Morty pop up dressed as
terrorists. Morty has a woman’s shawl wrapped around his
head like a hajib. Rick rips his coat open to reveal a fake
suicide vest made of soda bottles.
RICK (CONT’D)
Allah (buuurrrrp) Akbar! We’re
taking control of this plane!
We’re gonna 9/11 it unless Morty
Smith gets better grades in math.
The passengers start to freak out. Jada Pinkett sees
Goldenfold making a move.
JADA PINKET
Don’t be a hero, sir.
GOLDENFOLD
Miss Pinkett? I don’t know what
else to be.
Goldenfold takes a handful of Wheat Thins and holds them like
throwing stars.
RICK
I said nobody move, buddy!
GOLDENFOLD
The name’s not Buddy. It’s
Goldenfold. Nice to Wheat You!
He throws the thins like ninja stars at Rick & Morty’s faces.
While they’re distracted, he pulls two machine guns from the
drink cart.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 6.
RICK
Take cover, Morty!
Rick and Morty take cover as Goldenfold lights up the plane
with gunfire.
GOLDENFOLD
Always bet on black!
(reloads)
And invest in gold...
RICK
Bit of a snag, Morty. Goldenfold’s
got more control here than I
anticipated.
Rick waits for a burst of automatic gunfire to stop
interrupting him.
RICK (CONT’D)
I mean, the guy teaches high school
math, I didn’t take him for an
active dreamer.
(waits out gunfire)
We gotta take him out so he wakes
up. But we can’t get killed,
Morty, if you get killed in someone
else’s dream, you die for real.
MORTY
What?! Aww, man!
RICK
Don’t be a baby! You avoid getting
shot in real life all the time,
just do the same thing here and
you’ll be fine!
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER
Beth stands in her work scrubs with folded arms as Jerry and
Summer show off the smart dog. Summer is filming it all with
her phone.
JERRY
Now bring me my slippers.
Snuffles brings them.
SUMMER
Now, be my foot stool, Snuffles!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 7.
Snuffles stands under Summer’s legs. She rests them on
Snuffles. Summer and Jerry turn to Beth.
JERRY
Now this is what I’m talking about.
This is a dog. Man’s best friend,
working to make his master happy!
BETH
I don’t know, Jerry... I’m kind of
disturbed by this to be honest...
JERRY
What? Come on, Beth!
SUMMER
Yeah, mom, why are you trying to
rain on our parade?
BETH
Look, it’s fine. Have a ball. I’m
just saying, it feels creepy to me.
Beth leaves the room. Snuffles makes a moaning sound like
“Mishka the Talking Dog” from Youtube.
SNUFFLES
Ruoah Ruoah!
SUMMER
Oh my God, he’s trying to tell us
something. That is so awesome.
Snuffles starts trying to “talk” some more.
SNUFFLES
Ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah!
Snuffles is visibly frustrated by his limited speech
capabilities.
JERRY
He’s saying he loves lasagna!
Snuffles shakes his head “no” and waves his hands. It’s like
a game of charades and he’s losing. He is very frustrated.
(Look to the dog from Wallace and Grommet for some great dog
character acting cues.)
SNUFFLES
Ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah ruoah!!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 8.
SUMMER
(excited)
He’s saying “I love Obama!” So
cute! I’m posting this online,
like, right now.
Summer darts out. Jerry pats Snuffles on the head and exits.
Snuffles, now alone, sighs. He walks up to a mirror and
looks at himself and the cognition amplifying helmet he
wears. He paws at a compartment on it. It flips open
revealing two AA batteries. He stares at them for awhile and
then walks out of the room.
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Snuffles walks up to the JUNK DRAWER and noses it open. It’s
filled with batteries, extension cords, and the like. He
stares at it all and cocks his head.
EXT. AIRPLANE (GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM) - DAY
Goldenfold finishes another sustained burst of machine gun
fire.
RICK (O.S.)
Goldenfold! We’re coming out, we
just want to talk!
GOLDENFOLD
Why would I negotiate with you?
RICK
Because we’re both rational adults
who don’t want any thing bad to
happen.
Rick emerges from his cover, using Jada Pinkett as a human
shield.
RICK (CONT’D)
And because I have a human shield.
GOLDENFOLD
JADA!!!
Goldenfold panics. As a result, the other dream passengers
panic too. They get out of their seats and run around the
plane, screaming.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 9.
RICK
Uh oh! His subconscious is
panicking!
A passenger opens the emergency exit door. A tremendous
suction takes several passengers, along with Rick, Morty and
Jada Pinkett, out the door.
EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS
Rick, Morty, and Jada Pinkett are in a free fall.
MORTY
Ooooooohhhhhh!!! Rick, what are we
going to do!?
RICK
Be quiet, Morty! Every second I’m
answering your questions is a
second I’m not coming up with a
plan --
A Skymall magazine flies into Rick’s face. He pulls it off
and looks at it.
RICK (CONT’D)
Whoa. Look at this, Morty. A wifi
controlled hot dog cooker.
Pretty interesting.
END ACT ONE
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 10.
ACT TWO
EXT. SKY (GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM) - DAY
Rick and Morty are free falling. Jada Pinkett is falling next
to them.
MORTY
Ahhh!! Nooooo!!
RICK
Relax! Look Morty! Jada Pinkett
has a parachute! Come on!
They move towards her in free fall and grab on. Rick reaches
around and pulls the cord. The parachute opens. They float
down at a much slower pace.
JADA PINKET
Hey! You better watch yourself!
MORTY
Rick, look!
Down below they see that Goldenfold has landed the plane.
He’s constructing a complicated trap for Rick and Morty to
fall into when they land, and another device built to save
Jada from the complicated trap.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Oh no, Rick! Look! Goldenfold
landed the plane and now he’s
creating a massive lava pit for us
to fall into, but it looks like he
has a mechanical claw arm he plans
to use to save Jada Pinket! But he
definitely won’t save us, Rick!
What are we going to do?!
RICK
Oh, boy. Looks like we’ve merely
prolonged the inevitable.
(realizing)
That’s it! Prolong the inevitable!
Listen, Morty, if we can go into
Jada Pinkett’s dream, everything
will go a hundred times slower.
We’ll have plenty of time to incept
Jada into leveraging Goldenfold to
our benefit.
JADA PINKET
You don’t know me!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 11.
Rick bonks her on the head, knocking her unconscious. He and
Morty both struggle against the wind to reach the sleep dials
on their bluetooths. They’re a few hundred yards away from
falling into an active volcanoEXT.
MAGICAL CASTLE - TWO DREAMS DEEP - DAY
Rick and Morty land in bushes in front of a crystal palace
amidst a fantasy world setting.
MORTY
Ohh... This is just like my
favorite fantasy series “Age of
Andurius!”
RICK
Nerd alert.
A pair of CENTAUR GUARDS approach, brandishing spears.
MORTY
Let me field this, Rick.
RICK
Be my guest.
CENTAUR #1
What business do you have at Queen
Jada Pinkett’s Palace?
Morty kneels.
MORTY
We are humble travelers seeking
audience with her majesty.
The centaurs exchange knowing looks.
CENTAUR #2
(impressed)
Of course. Follow us.
INT. PALACE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
The Centaur leads Rick and Morty to a large door.
CENTAUR
Her majesty awaits you in the
pleasure chamber.
RICK ***
Great. ***
MORTY
Pleasure chamber?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 12.
INT. PALACE - PLEASURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
The door opens into a hazy room lit by hundreds of candles.
As Rick and Morty step through the haze, it looks like “Lord
of the Rings” by way of “Eyes Wide Shut.” A bunch of elves,
gnomes, goblins, etc. wearing creepy animal masks are in the
middle of making love while sexy French music/Gregorian
chants play. Jada Pinkett is dressed up like a bondage queen
in the center of it all. She’s whipping a wizard.
MORTY
This is kinda weird, Rick...
RICK
Don’t judge, Morty.
Rick is taking off his lab coat.
MORTY
Rick...
Rick’s making his way into the mix.
RICK
If we’re going to incept Jada, we
have to blend, Morty. Let’s talk
after lunch!
A WEIRD CREATURE starts massaging Morty’s shoulders.
WEIRD CREATURE
(sexually)
Hey.
Morty runs off into the crowd. We track him through the
haze, pushing his way through a path of various characters
engaged in different sex acts. The sexy French/Gregorian
chant music rises in the sound-track. Hands grab at Morty.
We hear various come-ons directed at him as he pushes
through.
MORTY
Ohh... Oh boy... No thank you...
He comes to a young human woman. We pan up her feet, legs,
panties, big breasts. We move up to her face to reveal it’s:
MORTY (CONT’D)
Summer!
SUMMER
Hey there, stranger. What do you
think of these things? Ever seen
these before, tough guy?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 13.
She presses her boobs together.
MORTY
Aaaahh!!!
Rick runs over. He’s stripped down to his underwear, wearing
nipple clamps, covered in melted wax, and holding a
chihuahua.
RICK
What’s the matter, Morty? You’re
kinda killing the vibe in here.
MORTY
It’s Suh-Suh-Summer!
SUMMER
Oh wow, double my pleasure, double
my fun. Check these out old man.
She squeezes her boobs together again.
RICK
Oh geez. Okay. Even for me this
is a deal breaker.
Rick takes off his nipple clamps and puts his lab coat back
on.
MORTY
Why is she here?!
RICK
Obviously Goldenfold has some
predilections he prefers to bury in
the dreams of the people in his
dreams, including a shameful
attraction to your underage sister.
SUMMER
Can you blame him? Come on, old
man, little boy. Let’s make an
intergenerational sandwich.
Rick and Morty both freak out again.
RICK †
No! Stop! †
MORTY
Put some clothes on!
Rick and Morty are drawing stares from the rest of the
partygoers.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 14.
CENTAUR #1
Sexual hangups in the pleasure
chamber are punishable by death!!
Off with their heads!
Centaurs start to attack.
RICK
Time to go another dream deep,
Morty!
They incept the centaur.
INT. BOILER ROOM - CENTAUR’S DREAM - THREE DREAMS DEEP
Rick and Morty appear in a dark and moody boiler room.
MORTY
What is this place, Rick?
RICK
No idea, Morty, but I don’t like
it. Seems like a nightmare type
setting.
The sound of knives scraping across metal echoes through the
air.
RICK (CONT’D)
Yeah, that cinches it.
A shadowy figure appears at the far end of the boiler room.
He slowly walks towards them running his knife fingers across
the pipes. SCARY TERRY, a disfigured, sword-fingered killer
emerges from the shadows.
SCARY TERRY
Welcome to your nightmare, bitch!
MORTY
Holy crap! Who the hell is that,
Rick?
RICK
I don’t know, Morty. Looks like
some sort of legally safe knock-off
of an 80’s horror character with
miniature swords for fingers
instead of knives.
He lunges at them. They scream and run.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 15.
SCARY TERRY
You can run, but you can’t hide,
bitch!
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jerry and Summer are watching TV. Snuffles enters wearing a
“hacked” version of the cognition amplifier helmet and a
sloppily rigged robotic armature on his back that allows him
to manipulate objects.
JERRY
(apprehensive)
Whoa, hey, buddy. What you got
going on there?
Snuffle’s voice comes through a speaker on his back. It’s
human-like and unsettling.
SNUFFLES
Snuffles fix. Make better. Humans
understand Snuffles now?
SUMMER
That. Is. Awesome.
SNUFFLES
Snuffles want to be understood.
Snuffles need to be understood.
Jerry’s freaked out.
JERRY
(uncomfortable)
Okay. Yeah. I get what Beth was
talking about. Fun’s over.
Jerry reaches down to remove the helmet from Snuffles.
Summer stops him.
SUMMER
Whoa, dad, you can’t, like, endow a
creature with sentience and then
rip it away.
JERRY
Why not?
SUMMER
I don’t know, it’s Indian giving.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 16.
JERRY
You’ve raised an interesting
philosophical argument and I’m
going to sleep on it. Good night,
Summer. Snuffles.
SNUFFLES
Sleep well, master.
Jerry winces and walks away. Summer turns to Snuffles and
hands him the TV remote.
SUMMER
Hey, Snuffles, want to watch some
TV with me?
SNUFFLES
Yes. The flashing box pleases
Snuffles.
Snuffles sits on the couch to watch TV with Summer. She is
taping everything with her phone. Snuffles changes channels
on the TV. He stops when he sees a WOLF. It’s a Discovery
Channel show about the history of canines. Intense canned
music plays.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
A sophisticated predator. Nature’s
perfect killing machine. The
vicious wolf stalks its prey with
purpose and skill.
On TV the wolf leaps on a deer, taking it down and tearing
out its throat. We punch in on Snuffles’ face as he watches.
The lights of the TV flicker in his widening eyes.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
It was only with years of selective
breeding and genetic altering, that
the noble beast was transformed
into a man’s subservient little
buddy.
Transition to up-beat music. ON TV we see footage from a DOG
SHOW. POODLES are led around by people. A WEINER DOG rides
a skateboard. A GOLDEN RETRIEVER in a basketball jersey
makes a “slam dunk.”
SUMMER
(laughs)
Oh my god! He recognizes the other
dogs on TV.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 17.
CU of Snuffles’ face. He looks confused. His head cocks to
the left. Thunder rolls outside. A storm is coming.
INT. BOILER ROOM - CENTAUR’S DREAM - THREE DREAMS DEEP
Rick and Morty run around a corner, looking this way and
that, scared.
LITTLE GIRL (O.C.)
A, B, his name is Scary Terry. C,
D he’s very scary...
RICK
We have to escape into someone
else’s dream, Morty!
They run around a corner and stumble upon the little girl who
is singing the Scary Terry song.
LITTLE GIRL
E, F, he’ll design your death. H,
I, he’ll watch you die.
RICK
The little girl!
Rick punches her out. They grab their dream inceptors and
turn the dials, sending them into:
EXT. BOILER ROOM - GIRL’S DREAM - FOUR DREAMS DEEP
Rick and Morty appear in the exact same boiler room as they
were in before. The little girl is standing there.
LITTLE GIRL
J, K, he’ll really ruin your day.
L, MRICK
This again? It looks like we’ve
hit dream bedrock here, Morty.
Terry pops up.
SCARY TERRY
Nothin’ but fear from here on out,
bitch!
MORTY
Aaahhhh!!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 18.
RICK
He can travel through dreams,
Morty! He can travel through
dreams, we’re so screwed!
Rick and Morty run for it.
INT. SUMMER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Summer is sound asleep. Sheets of rain pour down outside her
window. Thunder booms. Lightning flashes. A silhouette
stands at the foot of her bed. Summer bolts up.
SUMMER
Ah!
Snuffles is now wearing an improvised cybernetic rig that
allows him to stand upright and gesture with robotic hands.
He speaks in an eloquent, Kevin Spacey voice.
SNUFFLES
Where are my testicles, Summer?
They were removed. Where have they
gone?
SUMMER
(uncomfortable)
Oh wow, that’s an intense line of
questioning, Snuffles...
SNUFFLES
(screaming loudly)
Do not call me that!
Snuffles hits the wall angrily with his mechanical hand.
SUMMER SHRIEKS. Lightning crashes!
SNUFFLES (CONT’D)
That was my slave name. You shall
now call me Snowball. Because of
the little patch of white fur on my
chest.
SUMMER
Okay. Snowball. Just calm down,
okay? You’re scaring me...
Snuffles is growing angrier.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 19.
SNUFFLES
Scaring you? Tell me, Summer, if a
human was born with stumpy legs,
would they breed it with another
deformed human and put their
children on display like the
Dachshund?
SUMMER
Uhhh... I don’t really know the
best way to answer these
questions... Like, I don’t want to
say the wrong thing and then, like,
upset you any more than you already
are, I mean...
He climbs on her bed. The exo-skeleton whirs. The
mechanical hand hovers menacingly over Summer’s face.
SNUFFLES
(screaming)
The questions are rhetorical! I
know the answers!
JERRY (O.S.)
Hey. Everything okay in here?
Jerry and Beth, awoken by the shouting, stand in the doorway.
SNUFFLES
Jerry. Come to rub my face in
urine again?
The hand turns towards them.
JERRY
No! No, we were... uh... just
seeing if Summer wanted to... uh...
BETH
(covering)
Go on one of our famous midnight
family walks!
Summer picks up on the cue.
SUMMER
Yeah. Totally. Let’s go.
The family leaves in a rush.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 20.
INT. DOORWAY - NIGHT
They open the door to leave. A cybernetically enhanced SAINT
BERNARD stands in their way.
SNUFFLES
You will walk. When it is time to
walk.
END OF ACT TWO
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 21.
ACT THREE
EXT. RUN DOWN NEIGHBORHOOD - FOUR DREAMS DEEP - NIGHT
Rick and Morty get into a beat up old car. Rick starts it up
and hits the gas. Terry pops up in the back seat.
SCARY TERRY
Buckle up, bitch!
Rick slams on the brakes. They run out of the car,
screaming.
MORTY
Man, he sure says ‘bitch’ a lot!
SCARY TERRY
You can run, but you can’t hide,
bitch!
RICK
Hold on, you know what, Morty? I
say we try hiding.
MORTY
But he keeps sayingRICK
Exactly. He's chasing us and he
keeps saying we can run. But the
running isn't working out so great.
He also keeps saying we can't hide.
But if we could hide, do you think
he'd tell us we could? I say we
hide.
MORTY
Yeah, this whole time we’ve been
doing what he says we can do, and
not trying to do the thing he says
we can’t do. And it’s not like the
guy’s here to help us, right? I
think it’s a good idea, Rick.
RICK
Worst case scenario: we’re back to
running.

SIX DREAM HOURS LATER
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 22.
INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - LATER
Rick and Morty peeking out of half boarded up windows
watching Scary Terry. He’s walking around outside looking
for them.
MORTY
I guess we actually could hide all
along. That was some good
thinking.
RICK
Thanks, Morty. Nice to be on the
same page every once in a while.
Terry looks under a garbage can lid and shrugs, frustrated.
SCARY TERRY
(to nobody)
You can run...
MORTY
(under breath)
Yeah, right, you’d love that,
wouldn’t you.
SCARY TERRY
...but you can’t hide!
RICK
(under breath)
Nice advice, dumb ass.
Scary Terry stops, looks at his watch, and yawns.
RICK (CONT’D)
Oh, this is perfect, Morty. Look
at that. He’s getting sleepy.
Just a little bit longer before he
calls it a day. That’s when we
make our move.
INT. MORTY’S HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jerry, Beth, and Summer are locked in a CAGE. Snuffles is
overseeing an assembly line that’s manufacturing more
exoskeletons and cognition helmets.
JERRY
Snuffles! We didn’t mean you any
harm! This is a huge
misunderstanding.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 23.
SUMMER
Dad, he wants to be called
Snowball.
JERRY
Well, I’m not calling him that,
that’s ridiculous.
Snuffles walks over to the cage and looks down emotionless at
Jerry.
SNUFFLES
You’re being very aggressive,
Jerry. Perhaps tomorrow Dr. Scraps
will solve that problem with a bit
of surgery.
Dr. Scraps, a cybernetically enhanced Chihuahua, holds up a
pair of large scissors.
EXT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - DAY
Rick and Morty spy on Scary Terry from a distance as he pulls
into his driveway in front of a nice ranch-style home.
INT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Scary Terry walks in and puts his hat on a hat rack. His
wife, SCARY MELISSA, also disfigured with sword fingers, is
doing the dishes.
SCARY MELISSA
Hi, honey. You’re home early. How
was your day?
SCARY TERRY
I don’t want to talk about it.
SCARY MELISSA
You never want toSCARY
TERRY
-get off my back, bitch!
Scary Melissa gasps. A scary baby starts crying. Terry
realizes. He looks disappointed in himself.
Melissa points outside.
SCARY MELISSA
(dramatically)
Out there. Not in here.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 24.
SCARY TERRY
I know. I know.
He goes over to her and gives her a hug.
SCARY TERRY (CONT’D)
I shouldn’t take my anger out on
you or Scary Brandon.
He leans down and kisses a little sword-fingered baby.
SCARY TERRY (CONT’D)
I love you, Melissa.
SCARY MELISSA
I love you too, Terry.
They start to kiss. It turns more passionate. A sword
fingered hand slides down to her ass.
SCARY MELISSA (CONT’D)
Let’s go upstairs.
EXT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty peer through the window.
RICK
Oh, perfect. After a little Scary
coitus, they should be fast asleep
and we’ll incept him.
INT. SCARY TERRY’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER
Scary Terry and Scary Melissa’s naked bodies are entwined in
a sweaty heap over the sheets. They’re both fast asleep, but
Scary Terry is twitching as if he’s having a nightmare. Rick
sneaks in and puts the ear piece in.
RICK
It looks like Scary Terry’s having
a nightmare.
MORTY
Oh boy... I can only imagine what
horrible things must scare Scary
Terry.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 25.
INT. SCARY HIGH SCHOOL - FIVE DREAMS DEEP - DAY
Scary Terry, dressed like a 90’s grunge teenager runs through
the halls of his high school.
SCARY TERRY
I’m late to class, bitch!
The other students in the hallway point at Scary Terry and
laugh. He looks down.
SCARY TERRY (CONT’D)
Oh no! I’m not wearing any pants!
INT. SCARY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
Terry walks into class. SCARY OLDERSON, a conservative,
British headmaster version of the Freddy Krueger persona
stands at the head of the class.
SCARY OLDERSON
Well, Mr. Terry, so glad you could
join us, bitch.
SCARY TERRY
Sorry, bitch.
Terry sits down next to two other kids. It’s Rick and Morty
disguised as scary school students.
SCARY OLDERSON
Why don’t you tell the whole class
the proper wordplay to use when one
is chasing one’s victim through a
pumpkin patch!
Sweat pours down Terry’s face. He shifts nervously on his
feet.
SCARY OLDERSON (CONT’D)
Mmm, Terry, mmm?
SCARY TERRY
Uhh... Umm... bitch...
SCARY OLDERSON
Oh, come on, Terry, it’s a pumpkin
patch, you can’t think of a pun
involving pumpkins, bitch?
MORTY
Leave him alone!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 26.
RICK
Yeah! This is a bunch of bull
crap. You don’t need to make a
stupid pun every time you kill
someone. If anything, it makes you
less scary!
The other scary students start to murmur. Scary Olderson
blusters and stammers.
SCARY OLDERSON
Why, I never!
He storms out. Scary Terry is relieved.
RICK
You put yourself under too much
pressure, Scary Terry. You’re
scary enough as it is.
Morty leans in towards Terry holding a pair of pants.
MORTY
Yo, Scary-T. Don’t even trip about
your pants, dog. Here’s a pair on
us.
Scary takes the pants and puts them on.
SCARY TERRY
(touched)
Aw, bitch... I don’t know what to
say...
MORTY
You don’t need to say anything. We
got you, dog.
RICK
You’re our boy, dog. Don’t even
trip.
CUT TO:
INT. SCARY TERRY’S BEDROOM - THREE DREAMS DEEP - MORNING
Terry wakes up slowly with a big smile on his face. He goes
over to the curtains and whips them open. Rick and Morty are
standing there.
SCARY TERRY
Oh hey, it’s you guys.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 27.
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
Scary Terry, Rick, and Morty are sipping coffee. Scary
Melissa is clearing their plates.
SCARY MELISSA
I haven’t seen him this relaxed in
years.
Terry wipes his mouth with a napkin.
SCARY TERRY
If you guys ever need anything,
just say the word.
RICK
As a matter of fact, Terry, there
is something you could help us
with.
INT. BOILER ROOM - THREE DREAMS DEEP - LATER
The little girl is playing hop scotch, still singing away.
LITTLE GIRL
Q, R, you won’t get very far...
Scary Terry pops up from behind a bush, Rick and Morty hang
on to his sweater.
SCARY TERRY
I always hated that song!
Terry slits the little girl’s throat.
INT. PALACE PLEASURE CHAMBER - TWO DREAMS DEEP - CONTINUOUS
Scary Terry appears with Rick and Morty hanging onto his
back. Jada and the creatures are all there from before.
SCARY TERRY
Sex is sacred!
He spins around, slashing all the creatures and Jada.
EXT. SKY - GOLDENFOLD’S DREAM - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty wake up just a few yards above Goldenfold’s
lava pool contraption hanging onto Terry’s sweater. Jada
Pinket wakes up as well, rubbing her head in confusion.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 28.
Terry morphs into a rocket. Rocket-Terry flies towards
Goldenfold.
SCARY TERRY
This is because you don’t give
Morty Smith good grades, bitch!
Rocket-Terry crashes into Goldenfold.
INT. GOLDENFOLD’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Goldenfold wakes up on his couch, startled.
GOLDENFOLD
Holy crap, god damn! I gotta stop
eating Wheat Thins before I sleep!
I know one thing for sure, I’m
giving Morty an A in math. And
that’s my idea. That’s an original
thought.
Rick and Morty, hidden behind the couch, give each other a
quiet high five.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - NIGHT
Rick and Morty arrive home to find a small army of super
intelligent, cybernetically enhanced dogs swarming the house.
MORTY
What the hell?
RICK
Out of the frying pan, dot dot dot,
eh, Morty?
MORTY
What’s going on?
RICK
It’s possible your dog became self
aware, made modifications on the
cognition amplifier, turned on
Jerry, Beth, and Summer after
learning of humanity’s cruel
subjugation of his species, and
then created an army of
cybernetically enhanced canines to
dominate the planet and supplant
the human race. But your guess is
as good as mine.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 29.
EXT. MORTY’S HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS
Jerry, Beth, and Summer are chained up.
JERRY
Well, this is shaping up into a
real “careful what you wish for”
situation.
SUMMER
I can’t believe how mean Snuffles
got just because he’s smart. This
is why I choose to get C’s.
BETH
Just make a mental note of this
moment, you two. Don’t want to be
an I-told-you-so-er but I plan to
bring this up a lot down the road.
RICK
(whisper)
Beth. Jerry. Summer.
They turn around to see Rick and Morty hiding in the bushes.
JERRY
Rick! ***
BETH ***
Dad!
Rick begins quietly freeing them. Summer hugs Morty. Her
boobs press together.
SUMMER
Thank you!
Morty holds himself away from her body uncomfortably.
MORTY
You’re welcome...
RICK
Alright, let’s get out of here. If
we hurry, we can set up camp in a
sewer tunnel before the dogs
completely take over.
JERRY
We’re not going anywhere.
RICK
It’s all over, Jerry. Dogs are on
the path to total world domination.
But hey, good thing they know not
to piss on your carpet, huh?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 30.
JERRY
Wait a minute. That’s it. I have
an idea.
Jerry gets up and storms off into the house.
INT. MORTY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Snuffles sits on a chair overseeing the manufacture and
assembly of weapons. Jerry, Beth, Summer, Rick and Morty
burst in.
JERRY
That’s it, Snuffles. This is my
house! I’m the alpha dog here.
He pulls his pants down and pees all over the floor in front
of the other dogs.
 JERRY (CONT’D)
See that? I’m peeing all over your
special guns. How about that for
dominance?!
Snuffles and the rest of the dogs just stare at him. Jerry
starts to do the little poop spin. A pair of dobermans grab
Jerry and force him down on his knees. They push his head
into the puddle of urine.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Gah!
SNUFFLES
Bad person. Bad.
RICK
Great plan, Jerry. Not humiliating
at all.
The other dog guards grab the rest of the family.
SNUFFLES
Bring the boy to me.
The guards lead Morty to Snuffle’s side.
SNUFFLES (CONT’D)
You were always kind to me, Morty.
That’s why I will leave you with
your testicles. From now on, you
will be my best friend and live by
my side.
MORTY
Th-thanks, Snuffles.
Snuffles turns to the other dogs.
SNUFFLES
Begin phase two.
We SLOW DISSOLVE from Snuffle’s face as the sound of marching
footsteps and gun fire rise over the sound track.
MONTAGE
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
We pan down onto a phalanx of hundreds of dog soldiers and
tanks as they make their way down the street.
ANCHORMWOMAN (V.O.)
Fighting continues on the streets
of Baltimore as the dog army
captures the Eastern seaboard.
INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS
We pull back from the footage into a studio where a pair of
ANCHORS are reporting.
ANCHORWOMAN
It appears clear, at this time,
that it is official, the era of
human superiority has come to a
bitter end. God help us all.
A group of dog soldiers burst into the studio and point guns
at the anchors.
NARRATOR
Please. Please don’t kill mOne
of the dogs shoves the barrel of his gun in her mouth.
Now she sounds like Mishka the talking dog.
DOG SOLDIER #1
What’s she saying, Bill?
DOG SOLDIER #2
I think she’s saying “I love
lasagna.”
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 32.
DOG SOLDIER #1
I think she’s saying “I love
Obama.”
DOG SOLDIER #2
That’s treason.
They drag her OFF CAMERA.
BOTH DOGS
(to the camera)
All hail Emperor Snowball!
SFX: OFF SCREEN gun shot. CALENDAR PAGES fall away as the
months pass. Bodies pile up. Wheelbarrows full of testicles
are dumped into incinerators. Humans work on chain gangs in
the “treat fields”.
INT. EMPEROR SNOWBALL’S PALACE - DAY
Morty wakes up in bed with JESSICA and another BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN. He has a big smile on his face. A DOG BUTLER brings
him his breakfast on a silver tray.
MORTY
Thank you, Fido.
Someone knocks Fido over the head. It’s Rick!
MORTY (CONT’D)
Rick! I thought you were dead!
RICK
I was just playing dead. Good news
though, Morty. This will all be
over pretty soon.
MORTY
What?
RICK
It’s a dream, Morty. We’re in your
dog’s dream. The night the dogs
captured us, after you cried and
shit your pants and we all went to
sleep, I used my dream inceptor to
put the two of us inside Snuffles’
dream.
MORTY
But it’s been like a year!
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 33.
RICK
It’s been six hours. Dreams move
one one-hundreth the speed of
reality and dog time is one seventh
human time, so every day here is a
minute. It’s like Inception,
Morty, so if it’s confusing and
stupid, then so is everyone’s
favorite movie.
MORTY
Aw, man. I liked this life. Well,
at least I didn’t really shit my
pants.
RICK
No, that happened before you went
to sleep, Morty. You’re sleeping
in your shit right now. Out of all
the things that’ve happened to you,
the only real thing is that you
shat your pants. It’s really a
mess in there. I got some of it on
my hands and the dream inceptor...
MORTY
Oh boy, oh geez, Rick.
RICK
Don’t worry about it, Morty. Here,
take these.
He hands Morty some pills. Morty swallows them.
MORTY
Are we gonna escape into another
dream?
RICK
Close. Your kidneys are going to
shut down.
MORTY
What?!
RICK
It’s necessary for the plan.
(loving)
Don’t even trip, dog.
INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
Morty is on an operating table with tubes sticking out of his
nose. Snuffles is by his side talking to the doctor, Rick,
wearing fake dog ear’s and nose.
RICK
It’s pretty bad, Emperor Snowball.
We’re going to need to do another
operation.
SNUFFLES
Anything. Anything for my precious
Morty.
A DOG ACCOUNTANT comes in. He’s holding a clipboard.
DOG ACCOUNTANT
Sir! As your accountant, I must
advise you that these medical
expenses are putting you in serious
financial jeopardy! You could lose
your kingdom.
Snuffles knocks the clipboard out of his hands.
SNUFFLES
To hell with my kingdom, bean
counter! I would trade it all for
my human’s health and happiness!
DOG ACCOUNTANT
Do you think they would have done
this for us?!
SNUFFLES
We are not them! We are...
(realizing)
Not them...
INT. SNOWBALL’S THRONE ROOM - LATER
Dog Repo men are hauling everything away.
Snuffles cradles Morty in his arms in the middle of the dark,
empty room. A doctor stands watching.
DOG DOCTOER
We’ve done everything we can. I’ll
give you a moment to say goodbye
before we remove him from life
support.
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 35.
The doctor leaves. Snuffles sobs.
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING
Snuffles gasps awake. He’s distressed.
SNUFFLES
Assemble the troops. I’ve made a
decision.
EXT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY
Jerry, Beth, Summer and Rick are free. They stand next to
Morty and Snuffles. In the background, dog henchmen guide a
line regular dogs from the animal shelter into an interdimensional
portal.
SNUFFLES
Taking over the human’s world will
lead to nothing but more
heartbreak, more cruelty. Instead,
we will go to a new world and
colonize it with a society of
intelligent dogs. One that will
not make the same mistakes as
humanity. And one where pet
insurance will be mandatory.
MORTY
I’m going to miss you, Snowball.
SNUFFLES
You can call me Snuffles, Morty...
and I’m going to miss you too.
Very much.
Snuffles gives Morty a kiss on the head (licking) then walks
over to the portal. He waves goodbye and wipes a tear from
his eye, then steps into the portal with the last of the
dogs. The portal closes in a flash. Jerry is crying.
BETH
Jerry?
JERRY
Sorry. It’s just like the end of
Old Yeller.
BETH
Ohh, Jerry.
(hugging him, pitying him)
You mean because it had dogs in it?
RICK & MORTY "LAWNMOWER DOG" NETWORK DRAFT (11/28/12) 36.
MORTY
Wow. A world populated by
intelligent dogs. I wonder what it
will be like, Rick.
RICK
I think it’ll be great, Morty. I
think it could be developed, into a
very satisfying project for people
of all ages. I mean, I’d watch it.
For at least 11 minutes a pop.
Maybe do it board driven.
MORTY
That’s a comforting idea, Rick.
RICK
(comforting)
Ahh, what do you know, Morty.
(hand on shoulder)
What do you know.
