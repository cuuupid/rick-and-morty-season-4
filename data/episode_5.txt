RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT
ACT ONE
INT. SCHOOL - DAY
MORTY is walking through the halls of the school with other
students. We hear PRINCIPAL VAGINA over the loud speaker.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA (O.S.)
Principal Vagina here, don’t let
the name fool you, I’m very much in
charge, reminding you that tonight
is our annual flu season dance.
Morty gets to his locker. He looks down the hall at JESSICA,
who is standing with her friends.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
I don’t know how many times I have
to say this, but if you have the
flu, stay home. The flu season
dance is about awareness, not
celebration. You don’t bring dead
babies to Passover.
Morty takes a deep breath and heads over to Jessica.
MORTY
H-hey Jessica, um...
JESSICA
What’s up Morty?
Jessica sneezes delicately as BRAD (the jock) comes up and
snubs Morty.
BRAD
What are you doing?
MORTY
Well -
BRAD
Wait, were you about to talk... to
her?
MORTY
I was... thinking about it...
BRAD
Dude. Stay in your league. Look
how hot she is.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 1.
(MORE)
You don’t see me going to a bigger
school in a wealthier district and
hitting on their prettiest girl.
Brad throws his arm around Jessica and they walk away.
JESSICA
Gee, thanks, Brad.
BRAD
Look, I throw balls far, you want
good words, date a languager.
Morty is crestfallen.
EXT. MORTY’S HOUSE - DAY
PUSH IN
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Morty sits on a stool in the kitchen having a snack while
JERRY makes a sandwich.
JERRY
Try not to worry about it, Morty.
You’re a good kid. And there’s not
a premium on that right now but
you’ll be getting girls some time
after Brad’s out of shape.
MORTY
You’re missing the point, Dad. I
don’t want girls. I want Jessica.
Jerry takes his attention off the sandwich and looks Morty in
the eye.
JERRY
Ah. Well. I remember feeling that
way about a young lady named your
Mom. And that’s not an urban dis.
Your mom was my Jessica. I
remember the first time I saw her,
I thought -
RICK (O.S.)
“I should get her pregnant, then
she’ll have to marry me.”
RICK enters the kitchen and grabs a glass from the cupboard.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 2.
BRAD (CONT'D)
JERRY
I beg your pardon, Rick.
Inappropriate.
RICK
Sorry, please proceed with your
story about banging my daughter in
high school.
(to Morty)
I’m just not sure you want to take
romantic advice from this guy. His
marriage is hanging from a thread.
JERRY
My marriage is fine, thank you!
Rick gets ice from the fridge.
RICK
Jerry, it’s your house, whatever
you say is how it is, but I think a
blind man could see Beth is looking
for the door. I barely have a
reason to care and even I noticed.
MORTY
Hey, Rick! Don’t talk about my
parents like that!
Rick grabs the O.J. and pours it in his glass.
RICK
Listen, Morty. I hate to break it
to you, but what people call “love”
is just a chemical reaction that
compels animals to breed. It hits
hard, then slowly fades, leaving
you stranded in a failing marriage.
I did it. Your parents are doing
it. Break the cycle, Morty. Rise
above it. Focus on science.
Rick leaves the O.J. out and exits with his drink. Morty and
Jerry are left in sad silence.
MORTY
Well. I’m going to get dressed for
the dance.
JERRY
Yeah, I’m just going to...
(walking away)
...check on your Mom...
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 3.
INT. RICK’S LAB - DAY
Rick is working on some very important science device in the
garage when Morty enters, wearing a suit for the dance.
RICK
Hand me that screwdriver, Morty.
I’m almost finished making my ionic
defribulizer. It’s going to be
great.
Morty ignores Rick’s request.
MORTY
Listen, Rick. You know how you said
love is a chemical reaction and all
that? Well I was thinking... could
you do some science to make that
reaction happen inside Jessica? So
she falls in love with me? Like a
love potion?
RICK
Morty. That’s such a poor use of
my time. It’s beneath me, hand me
that screwdriver.
MORTY
No! I won’t hand you that
screwdriver! I won’t hand you any
screwdriver ever again, Rick! I’m
always helping you with what you
want, what about what I want, huh?!
Rick sighs and walks over to a different part of his work
bench. He pulls out a box and starts digging around.
RICK
You’re growing up fast, Morty.
You’re becoming a real big thorn,
growing straight up my ass.
Rick pulls a vial out of the box.
RICK (CONT’D)
Alright. This is called OXYTOCIN.
I extracted it from a vole, you
know what a vole is, Morty? It’s a
species of rodent that mates for
life. This is the chemical
released in a mammal’s brain when
it falls in love.
Rick pours the vole oxytocin into a strange device.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 4.
RICK (CONT’D)
I need a little bit of your DNA.
MORTY
Oh, well, okay...
Morty starts unbuckling his belt.
RICK
A hair, Morty, I need one of your
hairs, it’s not a gentlemen’s club.
Rick plucks a hair from Morty’s head and drops that in the
whirring device. The device dings and Rick grabs the serum
out of it and holds it up.
RICK (CONT’D)
Alright. Whoever you smear this
stuff on will fall in love with
you, and only you... forever.
Happy now, Morty?
MORTY
(taking it)
Yeah! Thanks, Grandpa Rick!
Morty heads for the door, pausing briefly.
MORTY (CONT’D)
There’s no danger, right, no side
effects?
RICK
What am I, a hack? Go nuts, Morty,
it’s foolproof.
Morty runs out. Rick goes back to his work.
RICK (CONT’D)
(shrugging, to self)
Unless she has the flu.
INT. JERRY AND BETH BEDROOM - DUSK
Beth is on the computer and Jerry sits on the bed.
JERRY
Do you still love me, Beth?
BETH
What kind of question is that?
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 5.
JERRY
The yes or no kind?
BETH
Jerry, do you want homeless people
to have homes?
JERRY
Yes.
BETH
Are you going to build them?
JERRY
...no?
BETH
Then what good was the yes.
JERRY
Wait, is loving me the house or the
homeless people?
BETH
Loving you is work, Jerry. Good
old fashioned Chinese work.
Because you say things like “do you
still love me,” to which I can say
no, and cause an apocalypse, or
yes, which means nothing, because
it requires nothing, like saying
the homeless should have homes.
Because in the end, I’m picking up
a hammer or I’m not. So do you see
me working here? Does this
conversation seem tedious?
JERRY
...sort of?
BETH
Then I obviously sort of love you,
don’t I, so stop asking and maybe
I’ll love you more.
Beth’s phone goes off. She hops up and grabs it.
BETH (CONT’D)
Crap. They need me at the horse
hospital.
JERRY
This late?
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 6.
BETH
The racetrack had a starlight
derby, there was a seven horse
collision and Davin’s there alone.
Beth rushes to get ready. We push on Jerry’s face as dozens
of voices whisper and chant the word “Davin” in his brain.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
We see dressed-up students entering the school in pairs.
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
Morty walks into the flu season dance, which is in full
swing. Morty scans the crowd, looking for Jessica. A
student rap group is rapping about flu awareness.
RAPPER
Flu. Yo. You gotta be aware,
aware of all the flu up in the air.
Morty spots Jessica next to her friend MOESHA, blowing her
nose. He heads her way.
RAPPER (CONT’D)
I’m a get me a shot make the flu go
away/
I’m a flu hatin’ rapper just
rappin’ away.
MORTY
Hey, Jessica... whoops!
Morty pretends to stumble forward and rubs Rick’s serum on
Jessica’s arm. On a dime, her focus turns entirely to Morty.
JESSICA
Oh my god... Morty... you look
really nice tonight.
MORTY
Thanks!
Jessica grabs Morty and pulls him close to her.
JESSICA
I love you, Morty. I love you so
much it burns.
MORTY
Whoa! I- I love you too, Jessica!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 7.
Brad sees this and rushes over.
BRAD
Is this punk bothering you,
Jessica?
Brad rips Morty away from Jessica and pushes him away.
JESSICA
Leave him alone, jerk! I’m in love
with him!
Jessica gets in Brad’s face.
JESSICA (CONT’D)
He’s more man than you’ll ever be!
She sneezes in Brad’s face. We follow little particles into
Brad’s brain, “CSI-Style” as they split and multiply.
Brad grabs his head. He appears dazed for a moment, then his
attention turns to Morty.
BRAD
Oh man, Morty... I’m really sorry.
MORTY
Oh. Well... No problem, Brad...
Brad gives Morty a hug. The hug turns into a slow dance.
BRAD
There’s something special about
you, Morty. So special.
Brad slides his hands down Morty’s back to his ass.
MORTY
Hey! Take it easy!
JESSICA
Get your hands off of him!
Jessica struggles with Brad to free Morty. Principal Vagina
and Goldenfold notice the scuffle and approach.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA
That’s enough, Bradley, we don’t
want you injuring your ballthrowing
arm.
Jessica pulls Morty away, takes him onto the dance floor, and
embraces him.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 8.
JESSICA
Never leave me, Morty. Never.
MORTY
Uh, sure, I mean... of course not.
What do you think that was all
about?
JESSICA
Who cares. Just hold me.
Other students are impressed with Morty landing Jessica.
Goldenfold and Principal Vagina haul Brad away while he kicks
and screams.
BRAD
I love you, Morty! Let go of me!
Brad sneezes violently several times. We ZOOM IN to show
micro droplets of snot fly from his mouth into nearby air
vents and the punch bowl.
INT. HOME LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jerry and SUMMER watch TV together. Jerry stares at his
phone.
JERRY
She’s going to be alone with that
guy all night.
SUMMER
Yeah, Dad, digging around the
insides of horses. It’s not a very
romantic setting.
RICK (O.S.)
Well, Summer, -
Rick has entered from the garage.
RICK (CONT’D)
There’s always the possibility she
made the work thing up. Maybe
Davin’s digging around in her
insides. Listen, Summer, I’m
almost done with my ionic
defribulizer and I could really use
someone to hand me screwdrivers -
SUMMER
Grandpa! So gross! You’re talking
about my Mom!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 9.
RICK
Well, she’s my daughter, I outrank
you.
(shrug)
Or, family means nothing. In which
case don’t play that card.
JERRY
She’s not responding to my texts!
SUMMER
Careful, Dad. Jealousy turns women
off.
JERRY
Well isn’t that convenient.
RICK
Not for the men they cheat on, no.
JERRY
(standing up)
Okay. I’m going to go out. For
some ice cream. And maybe stop by
the hospital. To support my wife.
With my confidence.
Jerry takes off.
SUMMER
God, Grandpa, you’re such a dick.
RICK
I’m sorry, Summer, your opinion
means very little to me. How come
you’re not at this dance everyone
loves so much?
SUMMER
Screw that. I don’t want to get
sick. It’s flu season.
Rick looks concerned.
RICK
It is?
SUMMER
Yes.
We PUSH IN on Rick’s face.
RICK
Oopsie.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 10.
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
Jessica grinds on Morty in the middle of the dance floor.
MORTY
Please just let this work out.
Jessica stops grinding on Morty, gets on all fours and
“presents rearly” to him, making animal noises.
JESSICA
Do it, Morty. Do it. Rip my
clothes off and mate with me for
life.
MORTY
Uh... can we maybe go somewhere
more private?
Moesha and several other students walk over.
MOESHA
Jessica, get ahold of yourself.
You don’t deserve to carry Morty’s
genes.
Moesha starts caressing Morty. Morty backs away as the band
begins playing “Morty is forever.” Morty looks around to see
everyone in the dance is now focused on him.
MORTY
Oh crap...
Jessica jumps up and tackles Moesha while other students claw
at Morty and fight with each other. Morty rips away and
scrambles out of the throng with half of his suit ripped off.
Rick bursts into the gym and grabs Morty by the arm.
RICK
Morty! Come on, we gotta get you
out of here! I made a rare
mistake!
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty run from the gym. Principal Vagina is running
toward them from the other end of the hall.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA
Morty, are you okay?
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 11.
MORTY
Yes.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA
Good. If anything ever happened to
you, I’d kill myself. I love you
bad, Mo-mo.
Mr. Goldenfold rounds the corner.
GOLDENFOLD
Morty, the principal and I have
discussed it and decided we’re both
insecure enough to agree to a threeway.
Rick and Morty run outside.
EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT
Rick and Morty run across the parking lot towards Rick’s
flying ship as the entire school spills out into the parking
lot after them. They jump in and Rick struggles to get the
ship started.
RICK
I didn’t realize when I gave you
that serum that Jessica had the
flu. That’s something you might
have mentioned, Morty.
The crowd envelopes the vehicle. Several climb onto it.
Rick finally gets it moving forward.
MORTY
What’s happening?
RICK
What’s it look like, Morty? The
serum is piggybacking on the virus,
it’s gone airborne, Morty. Being
hot for you has gone airborne.
MORTY
Oh, crap!
RICK
Relax. I just need to formulate a
cure before this thing reaches a
major city.
Just before the vehicle gets off the ground, A BOSTONIAN
leaps onto the car and presses his face on the windshield.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 12.
BOSTONIAN
Mahty, I’m from Bahston, we wicked
love ya there!
RICK
Uh oh.
Rick pulls out a small phaser gun and zaps the Bostonian off
the ship, sending him plummeting to the parking lot below.
RICK (CONT’D)
This might be an all nighter.
END OF ACT ONE
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 13.
ACT TWO
EXT. CITY - NIGHT
A throng of love sick citizens are moaning Morty’s name.
Rick’s ship hovers into frame above them.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Morty looks down, nervous.
MORTY
Oh man! What do we do, Rick?
RICK
We should be fine. I’ve whipped up
an antidote. It’s based on praying
mantis DNA.
Rick holds up a vial and pours it into a small hatch on the
dashboard.
RICK (CONT’D)
See, romantically, praying mantises
are the opposite of voles. They
mate once and then decapitate the
male. It’s a real Wham-bam-thankyou-mantis
kind of thing, not that
wordplay is my wheelhouse. Mantis
DNA mixed with a more contagious
flu virus should neutralize the
effects of the original serum.
Rick pilots the ship in place above a crowd of people rubbing
themselves and moaning Morty’s name. He pulls a lever
sending a mist down onto them.
RICK (CONT’D)
By the way, don’t worry: I don’t
want to fuck you. These serums
don’t work on anyone related to you
genetically.
The crowd of people moaning Morty’s name stop doing it. For
a beat. Then, they mutate into hideous insect monsters and
resume moaning Morty’s name.
RICK (CONT’D)
Okay. Well. Sometimes science is
more art than science, Morty, a lot
of people don’t get that.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 14.
INT. CAR - NIGHT
Jerry is speeding down the freeway. He hits the brakes.
EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS
We see Jerry’s car skid to a stop behind rows and rows of
abandoned cars sitting in all lanes of the freeway. The door
opens and Jerry steps out into the night.
JERRY
Come on are you kidding me?!
Hello?!
Three MANTIS MUTANTS burst out of the shadows and rush
towards Jerry.
MANTIS MUTANTS
You’re not Morty! Bring us Morty!
Jerry dodges the monsters and runs into the abandoned cars
where he comes across a dead cop holding a shotgun. He grabs
it, turns around, and blows the monsters away.
JERRY
(dramatic)
Nobody’s killing me until after I
catch my wife with another man.
INT. HOME LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Summer is now alone watching TV.
TV SHOW GIRL 1
I had sex with Billy.
TV SHOW GIRL 2
But you were already pregnant!
TV SHOW GIRL 1
Yeah, so, what’s the worst that
could happen?
NEWS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
- We interrupt Pregnant Baby with
breaking news.
SUMMER
Aww come on!
Two half mantis mutant news anchors sit next to each other
with an image of Morty on the screen.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 15.
MANTIS NEWS LADY
This just in: Morty Smith’s
whereabouts are still unknown. The
only thing that is known is how
cute he is.
MANTIS NEWS MAN
I love him so much. I want to make
love to him and then eat his head.
MANTIS NEWS LADY
I love him more than you do,
Harold.
MANTIS NEWS MAN
(growling rage)
You wish, you spider-eating slut!
They begin to attack each other. Summer pulls her feet back
up off the ground and onto the couch. She’s afraid.
SUMMER
What the hell?
Summer flips to another channel showing coverage of riots in
the Middle East. It’s revealed that all the rioters are halfmantis
and holding signs that say “We Love Morty!,” etc.
A group of them have hung an effigy of Morty in a courtyard
and are humping it.
Suddenly there is a pounding on the door. It breaks open and
several mantis mutants burst in.
MANTIS MUTANT
Where is Morty?!
Summer screams at the top of her lungs, grabs a vase and
breaks it over a mantis monster’s head. She then runs past
several more outside into the night.
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT
Rick has his flying machine parked, and has set up a
makeshift laboratory out of the trunk. They have a small TV
propped on the trunk playing the same TV news program that
Summer was watching. The Chinese are doing an elaborate show
about how they love Morty and want to make love to him and
then eat him. Morty turns it off and starts freaking out.
MORTY
The whole world is infected, Rick!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 16.
RICK
(casual and relaxed)
Pretty wild how fast that spread.
I’ve really outdone myself.
MORTY
(furious)
Outdone yourself? This isn’t okay,
Rick! Not only do they all want to
have sex with me, now they all want
to eat me afterwords!
RICK
Yeah, I don’t know what I was
thinking. Mantises are the
opposite of voles? Obviously DNA
is a little more complicated than
that.
Rick holds up a freshly concocted vial.
RICK (CONT’D)
This will do the trick, though.
It’s koala mixed with rattlesnake,
chimpanzee, cactus, shark, golden
retriever and a smidge of dinosaur.
Should add up to normal humanity.
MORTY
What?! How does that add up to
normal humanity?!
RICK
What, you want me to show you my
math? I’m sorry, Morty, are you
the scientist or the kid that
wanted to get laid?
EXT. HORSE HOSTPITAL - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT
INT. DAVIN’S - NIGHT
Davin and Beth enter, removing their gloves, spattered in
horse blood.
DAVIN
I’m glad we saved all those horses,
but I’m almost sorry we’re
finished.
BETH
It’s satisfying work.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 17.
DAVIN
It’s more than the work. I love
being in that sterilized room,
sealed off from the world. It’s
the only time I can really think.
And feel.
He sneezes lightly, then presses a button on his wall.
African dream pop starts playing.
BETH
What are you doing?
DAVIN
I’m playing African dream pop.
What do you do after a long night?
The lights dim. A special mechanism lights a candle on his
desk.
BETH
I better get going. Jerry’s been
texting some pretty high
maintenance stuff.
DAVIN
Beth.
He physically stops her.
BETH
What is it, Davin?
DAVIN
Just once, I’d like to know...
(sneeze)
...what it was like to give your
son a bath.
BETH
Uhhhh WHAT?
DAVIN
What does Morty’s skin smell like?
How soft --
(twitch)
How soft are his privates --
BETH
Let go of me, Davin!
Davin growls and mutates into a hideous half-mantis. Beth
screams.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 18.
DAVIN
Take me to Morty.
Jerry kicks the door open. Davin looks at him.
DAVIN (CONT’D)
You’re not Morty.
JERRY
No. I’m Mister Crowbar.
(holds up crowbar)
And this. Is my friend. Who is
also a crowbar.
DAVIN
That’s... stupid --
Jerry smashes Davin in the head with the crowbar, then
methodically beats him to death.
JERRY
Yeah, well, look where being smart
got you.
BETH
(recovering)
Jerry! Thank God!
JERRY
God? God’s turning people into
insect monsters, Beth. I’m the one
beating them to death. Thank me.
Beth embraces Jerry.
BETH
Thank you, Jerry. Thank you.
Jerry holds his wife and looks around with a hardened
expression in his face. This is his moment.
EXT. CITY - NIGHT
Rick’s ship flies over the infected city.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
RICK
Take a good look down there, Morty,
and soak it in, because as soon as
I pull this lever, it’s all going
to change back to normal.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 19.
MORTY
Just do it already!
RICK
Well, technically, there’s no rush,
I mean, once it’s fixed, it’s fixed
--
Morty hops up and pulls the lever.
EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS
The ship crop-dusts the city with gas. We follow the gas
down as it hits an aggressive crowd of mantis mutants. The
mutants double over in agony for a moment, and then rise back
up, back to normal. Just a crowd of humans.
INT. RICK’S SHIP - CONTINUOUS
Rick takes his attention away from the crowd below and turns
to Morty. Morty continues to watch.
RICK
Well what do we have here? Looks
like I was right and you doubted
me. I bet you feel pretty stupid
right now, don’t you, Morty? I bet
you feel like the world’s smallest
man.
MORTY
Something’s not right...
Rick takes his flask out and takes a gulp.
RICK
Yeah, you. You’re not right.
Ever.
MORTY
No! Look, you idiot!
Rick turns and looks down below.
EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS
Everyone is bubbling and writhing around. They mutate into
horrible deformed mutants. They’re monstrosities. Fleshy.
Massive. Violent. Unrecognizable.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 20.
EXT. HONG KONG - CONTINUOUS
We see Chinese mantis people riding bikes, running markets,
they mutate into these beasts and devolve into chaos.
EXT. RUSSIA - CONTINUOUS
We see Russian mantis people playing checkers, eating
potatoes, they mutate into these beasts and devolve into
chaos.
EXT. IRAQ - CONTINUOUS
We see Iraqi mantis people already devolved into chaos. They
mutate into these beasts and resume.
INT. RICK’S SHIP
Rick takes another sip of his flask.
RICK
I bet you’re loving this, Morty.
This must be the best day of your
life. You get to be the mayor of
“I-told-you-town.” You’re welcome.
END OF ACT TWO
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 21.
ACT THREE
EXT. CITY - NIGHT
We see a van rigged up with armor and weapons a la Road
Warrior. Several beasts block their path.
INT. ARMORED VAN - CONTINUOUS
Jerry is behind the wheel as Beth cuddles close to him.
JERRY
Hold on.
Jerry slams the gas pedal. Several creatures fly into the
windshield and roll off as the van speeds through the crowd.
EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS
Jerry and Beth’s armored van cuts a path of death through the
fleshy beasts.
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - SUNRISE
Jerry and Beth pull their Road Warrior vehicle onto their
front lawn and get out, taking out a horde of beasts with a
sawed-off shotgun and a machete.
Jerry regards Beth’s shotgun.
JERRY
I wish that shotgun was my penis.
BETH
If it is, you can call me
Hemingway.
JERRY
I don’t get it and I don’t need to.
Jerry grabs Beth and they make out.
SUMMER (O.S.)
Mom?! Dad?!
Summer runs over and they all embrace.
BETH *
Summer! *
JERRY
Summer!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 22.
JERRY
Where’s Morty?
SUMMER
I don’t know. Do you think
Grandpa Rick had something to do
with this?
JERRY
It’s not fair to assume that,
Summer.
BETH
Not fair? Give me a break. He’s a
selfish, irresponsible ass and he
left my mother. A real man stands
by his woman.
Jerry and Beth make out some more.
SUMMER
Um...
EXT. ROOF TOP - MORNING
Rick and Morty sit against Rick’s parked ship, looking down
at the chaos below. Everybody is shuffling around as
shapeless, fleshy beasts. They’re all moaning.
RICK
Man, I really Cronenberged the
world up, didn’t I? We got a
planet full of Cronenbergs walking
around down there, Morty. At least
they’re not in love with you
anymore. That’s a huge step in the
right direction.
MORTY
It’s a living nightmare! How could
you be so irresponsible, Rick?
RICK
Me irresponsible? All I wanted to
do was make an ionic defribulizer.
Irresponsible is abandoning science
because you want to do it with
girls. That’s the behavior that
overpopulated this world. This is
just chickens coming home to roost.
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 23.
MORTY
Alright fine. I should have
listened when you refused to make
that serum. I’m willing to accept
my part of the blame for this.
Rick takes a swig of his flask. Morty stands up.
MORTY (CONT’D)
But you need to accept yours! And
you need to get off your ass and
figure out some way to fix this
mess, Rick! I’m serious!
Rick gets up and brushes himself off.
RICK
We’re in a pretty deep hole with
this one, but I do have one
emergency solution that could put
everything back to normal.
Relatively speaking.
Rick pops the trunk on his ship and pulls out a couple of
strange looking backpacks. He hands one to Morty.
MORTY
Here, put this on while I do a
little scouting.
CUT TO:
EXT. MORTY’S HOUSE - MORNING
Birds are chirping, everything seems fine. A perfectly human
neighbor mows his lawn.
Rick’s flying car lands in the driveway. Rick and Morty get
out and head towards the garage.
MORTY
Wow. We’re pretty lucky you
finally figured out the exact
combination of DNA that returned
everyone back to normal.
RICK
Luck had nothing to do with it,
Morty. I’m just that smart.

INT. RICK’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
Rick goes back to his workbench and resumes work on the
device he was making in the beginning of the episode.
RICK
Now will you help me finish my
ionic defribulizer?
MORTY
Sure thing Rick. Here’s a
screwdriver.
Morty hands him a screwdriver and Rick starts tinkering with
the device.
RICK
Allllmost done, aaaaand --
The device explodes violently. Rick and Morty are instantly
killed. Their dismembered bodies slide like rag dolls across
the garage floor.
A few seconds of silence, and then a portal opens and Rick
and Morty walk through it into the garage wearing the strange
backpacks Rick handed Morty earlier.
RICK (CONT’D)
Here we are, Morty.
MORTY
Oh my god, is that us?! We’re torn
to pieces! What is going on, Rick?
I’m freaking out!
Rick grabs Morty by the shoulders and shakes him.
RICK
Calm down, Morty. Look at me.
Calm down.
MORTY
No way oh my god. Oh nooo. This is
too much. Oh my god. Oh nooo. Oh
my god.
RICK
Calm down, Morty! You just have to
calm down and listen to me! Morty,
calm down!
MORTY
Oh nooo this can’t be real! Oh
nooo! Oh my god!
RICK & MORTY "LOVE PANDEMIC" NETWORK DRAFT (11/16/12) 25.
Rick slaps Morty hard across the face.
RICK
Shut up and listen to me! It’s
fine! Everything is fine! There’s
an infinite number of universes,
Morty. And in a few dozen of
those, I got lucky and turned
everyone back to normal. I just
had to find one of those universes
in which we also happened to both
die around this time.
Rick takes his hands off Morty’s shoulders and stands up.
RICK (CONT’D)
Now we can just slip into the place
of our dead selves in this universe
and everything’ll be fine. We’re
not skipping a beat, Morty. Help
me with these bodies.
Rick starts gathering himself up.
MORTY
This is insane.
RICK
Look, I’ll grab myself, you grab
yourself, OK? That seems fair to
me. That’s a fair way to do it.
MORTY
Rick! What about the universe we
left behind?!
RICK
What about the universe where
Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The
answer is don’t think about it.
It’s not like we can do this every
week. We get three or four more of
these, tops. Now pick your dead
self up. Come on. Haste makes
waste.
(adding)
I don’t suppose you’ve considered
this detail, but obviously, if I
hadn’t screwed up as much as I did,
we’d be these guys right now. So,
once again, you’re welcome.

EXT. NEW WORLD MORTY’S HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY
“Look On Down From The Bridge” by Mazzy Star plays as Rick
and Morty quietly dig graves for their own dead bodies.
Morty looks over at the pile of himself and stares at it for
a moment. Rick notices he’s not digging and nudges him back
to work.
INT. HOUSE - DAY.
The song continues to play over the scene. Rick and Morty
walk in the door to find Jerry and Beth arguing in the
kitchen. Rick plops down on the couch next to Summer, who is
watching TV. Rick seems perfectly comfortable with all of
it.
Morty takes his seat on the couch but looks forever changed,
taking in his normal surroundings, with no idea what to say,
so he says nothing.
The camera pulls back.
We cut to credits, Sopranos/Breaking Bad style, as the song
continues.
THE END

TAG
INT. ORIGINAL WORLD (OR “WORLD 1”) - 2 YEARS LATER - DAY
Beth and Jerry cuddle lovingly next to a spit-roasting beast.
Summer acts out scenes from a movie she remembers for their
entertainment.
SUMMER
You know the thing about a shark,
he’s got lifeless eyes. Black eyes
like a doll’s eyes. When he comes
at ya, he doesn’t seem to be living
until he bites ya and those black
eyes roll over and white and then,
ah...
They all seem content. Perfect marriage, perfect family.
JERRY
Do you ever wonder what happened to
Rick and Morty?
BETH
Sometimes. But I’m ashamed to
admit, now that they’re gone, I’m
finally happy.
CUT TO:
EXT. ORIGINAL WORLD 1 - SOMEWHERE ELSE - DAY
A portal opens. Cronenberged versions of Rick and Morty walk
through wearing the same strange backpacks we saw before.
CRONENBERG RICK (VICK)
Here we are, Sorty. A universe
where everyone in the world got
genetically cronenberged. We’ll
fit right in. It’ll be like we
never left cronenberg world.
CRONENBERG MORTY
Yeah, Vick, but I’m gonna miss
cronenberg world. Because everyone
was cronenberged all along like us
from the beginning. I wish we
hadn’t genetically ruined
cronenberg world beyond repair like
we did, you know?

CRONENBERG RICK
Don’t worry about that. Come on.
Lets make ourselves at home.
