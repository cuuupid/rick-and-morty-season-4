ACT ONE
EXT. GARAGE - DAY
Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. An otherwise
perfectly normal day.
INT. LAB - DAY
Rick stands at his workbench, dissecting a road-killed
opossum.
RICK
Well, this is just sloppy
craftsmanship.
He takes a drink from his flask. Morty enters.
MORTY
Hey, Rick, is it me, or this an
especially beautiful day?
Rick doesn’t bother looking up.
RICK
(sarcastic)
Ohhh yes, Morty. Almost
unbelievable, isn’t it?
MORTY
Yeah, there’s something about the
air, and the sunshine, it’s got me
in a real mood, like anything’s
possible.
RICK
Sure, buddy, sure. Brilliant. Very
convincing.
MORTY
Convincing?
RICK
Oh, responsive, too, in real time,
I love it.
MORTY
Um. Okay.
Beth enters. Something is “off” about her.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 1.
BETH
I’m going to work. Morty, good
morning. Dad, good morning. I’m
going to work. Goodbye.
She leaves.
MORTY
What’s with Mom?
RICK
Oh, “what’s with Mom?” So, you’re
saying that she’s acting weird. How
sophisticated --
(shouts at ceiling)
Careful, guys, you’re going to burn
out the CPU with this one!
MORTY
Okay, you’re acting weird, too.
I’ll see you after school.
RICK
Sure thing, quote unquote “Morty.”
Morty leaves. Rick watches him go, intrigued.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
Morty is seated at his desk. GOLDENFOLD begins class.
GOLDENFOLD
All right, I’m your teacher so
let’s begin this class. Who can
tell me what five times nine is?
All the students but Morty audibly murmur to each other in
intrigue and confusion.
GOLDENFOLD (CONT’D)
Morty?
MORTY
Hm?
GOLDENFOLD
Five times nine.
MORTY
Um. You know, it’s, uh.
(nervous, counting)
It’s. It’s at least forty, so --
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 2.
The class gasps in astonishment and murmurs to each other.
GOLDENFOLD
Morty, that’s exactly correct. Five
times nine is at least forty, come
up here.
The class applauds as Morty cautiously walks to the front.
Goldenfold puts an arm around him.
GOLDENFOLD (CONT’D)
This is the best student.
(to Morty)
You’re the best student, Morty. I
want you to be the teacher today.
MORTY
You do?
JESSICA smiles at Morty and gives him a thumbs up.
EXT. CLASSROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS
Rick approaches the classroom window and peers in
suspiciously.
RICK
Interesting.
INT. CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS
Goldenfold takes a seat in the class.
GOLDENFOLD
Teach us, Morty.
MORTY
Teach you what?
A random student raises his hand.
STUDENT #1
Oo! How do you make concentrated
dark matter?
GOLDENFOLD
Oh, that’s a good question.
MORTY
Concentrated huh?
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 3.
GOLDENFOLD
Concentrated dark matter. The fuel,
for accelerated space travel. Do
you know how to make it?
MORTY
Um...
JESSICA
Come on, Morty. Isn’t your grandpa
like a scientist?
MORTY
Oh. Yeah, but Rick doesn’t really
like me talking about his science
with anyone -
JESSICA
I bet you’ve seen him make
concentrated dark matter a lot. If
you tell us, I’ll be your
girlfriend.
MORTY
You will?
GOLDENFOLD
Seems like a rare opportunity,
Morty.
MORTY
Uh, well, first you, I think he
might have used... something...
positronic... or plutonic... or...
proto --
Rick bursts into the classroom.
RICK
(feigning concern)
Morty! There’s a family emergency!
Rick pulls Morty away by his arm.
GOLDENFOLD
If he leaves I’m giving him an F!
RICK
He doesn’t care!
MORTY
Aw, man!
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 4.
INT. HIGH SCHOOL SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER
Rick drags Morty through a locker room into the shower and
starts disrobing.
MORTY
Rick! I have to go back! I think I
was about to get married!
RICK
Take a shower with me, Morty.
MORTY
What?
RICK
Listen to me, Morty! Get your
clothes off and get in here, NOW.
TRUST ME.
Rick is now naked and turning on a shower head. Morty
begrudgingly removes his clothes and joins Rick in the
shower.
MORTY
I’m gonna get an F in class, Rick!
RICK
That’s not class, Morty. That
wasn’t your teacher, this isn’t
your school, this entire world is
not the world. We’re inside a huge
simulation chamber on an alien
spaceship.
MORTY
What?
RICK
It’s all fake, Morty, all of it.
Nanobotic renderings. I couldn’t
say so until we got in the shower,
they won’t monitor us in here.
MORTY
Monitor us? Who?
RICK
Zigerion Scammers, Morty. The
galaxy’s most ambitious, least
successful con artists. Lucky for
us, they’re also very uncomfortable
with nudity.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 5.
MORTY
Aww, come on, Rick! If everyone’s
going to be insane today, at least
let me be with insane Jessica!
Morty heads for his clothes.
RICK
I can’t let you do that, Morty!
Rick runs past him and grabs his clothes.
MORTY
Rick! What the hell, man! Give me!
RICK
No, you!
As they nude-struggle over Morty’s clothes:
We PULL BACK, through the locker room wall, through the walls
of the school, past trees that are still being rendered and
unrendered by gaseous clouds of nanotech, and finally out of
a computer monitor in:
INT. ALIEN CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The control room of an alien ship. We move down a bank of
computer monitors aligned in a row like an internet cafe,
with an ALIEN at each one, monitoring some scene from Morty’s
fake world.
When we arrive at the monitor displaying Rick and Morty
wrestling in the locker room, the volume is down, and we see
that the alien at that monitor has his back turned to it.
He’s grossed out.
ALIEN #1
Sir. They’re... still naked.
The alien leader, PRINCE NEBULON, doesn’t want to look
either.
PRINCE NEBULON
Well, check every five quintons and
tell me when they’re not.
ALIEN #1
I think we should make Kevin look,
sir.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 6.
KEVIN
What? No! No way! What? Why would
you say that?
ALIEN #2
Uh, sir? We have a situation over
here.
PRINCE NEBULON
Now what?
ALIEN #2
Something’s drawing a lot of
processing power. Wait... no
wonder. There’s another real human
in the simulator. He’s driving.
One of the aliens is seated in front of a monitor looking at:
JERRY, in the driver’s seat of a car.
INT. JERRY’S CAR - DAY
Jerry is driving along, intently focused, talking to himself.
JERRY
Okay, Jerry. Big pitch meeting.
Make or break time. You can do
this.
INT. ALIEN CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Prince Nebulon angrily addresses the control room.
PRINCE NEBULON
How did this happen? Where’s the
Abductions department?
ABDUCTIONS ALIEN
Hey, man, Abductions just follows
the acquisition order.
ACQUISITIONS ALIEN
Don’t put this on Acquisitions. We
only acquire humans that haven’t
been simulated.
SIMULATIONS ALIEN
Well, Simulations doesn’t simulate
anybody that’s been abducted --
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 7.
PRINCE NEBULON
Oh my God, what does it take to get
you guys in a room together before
you screw up like this? Who’s this
extra human we picked up?
ALIEN #2
Rick’s son-in-law, Jerry Smith. So
far he hasn’t noticed he’s in a
simulation.
PRINCE NEBULON
Well, cap his sector at five
percent processing, keep his
settings on auto and we’ll deal
with him later, Rick Sanchez is the
mark.
INT. JERRY’S CAR - DAY
Jerry is still driving, but now he’s passing the same three
stores and two kinds of tree. He doesn’t notice. Too stressed
out.
JERRY
Gotta relax. It’s just a pitch.
Gotta relax.
He reaches out and turns on his radio.
RADIO VOICE
This is Earth radio. Here’s human
music.
A ridiculously simplistic, three note song plays. Jerry looks
at it for a moment, then nods his head to it.
JERRY
Human music. I like it.
We PULL BACK from Jerry’s car until it’s revealed that Jerry
is technically stationary while clouds of nanotech “render”
the road, trees and stores moving past him.
We move away from this, across a bit of empty space and then
through a chunk of rendering neighborhood, arriving at:
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
Rick finishes throwing his and Morty’s clothes down a storm
drain as Morty runs up to him cupping his own privates.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 8.
MORTY
Rick!
RICK
(grabbing his arms)
Ah ah, Morty! Keep your hands off
your ding-dong, it’s the only way
we can speak freely.
(turning him)
Look around you, Morty. Do you
really think this world is real?
You’d have to be an idiot not to
notice all the sloppy details.
He gestures toward a hot dog vendor.
RICK (CONT’D)
That guy is putting a bun between
two hot dogs.
MORTY
I’ve seen people do that before at
school.
RICK
Well look at that old lady. She’s
walking a cat on a leash.
MORTY
Mrs. Spencer does that all the
time!
RICK
I don’t want to hear about Mrs.
Spencer, Morty. She’s an idiot.
There, what about that?
Rick points over to a giant toaster where a house should be.
A large pop tart walks out holding a briefcase. It gets in a
smaller toaster and drives away.
MORTY
OK, you got me on that one.
RICK
(sarcastically)
Oh, really, Morty? Are you sure you
haven’t seen that somewhere before?
MORTY
No, no. I haven’t. I mean, why
would a pop tart want to live
inside a toaster? That would be the
scariest place for them.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 9.
RICK
You’re missing the point, Morty.
Why would he drive a smaller
toaster with wheels? Does your car
look like a smaller version of your
house? No.
MORTY
So... why are they doing this? What
do they want?
RICK
That would be obvious to you,
Morty, if you’d been paying
attention.
An ambulance screeches around the corner, the doors fly open
and two paramedics pop out.
PARAMEDIC
Help! We’ve got the president of
the United States in here! We need
ten cc’s of concentrated dark
matter stat or he’ll die!
Rick kicks the doors closed and continues walking with Morty.
MORTY
Concentrated dark matter. They were
asking about that in class.
RICK
It’s a special fuel I invented to
travel through space faster than
anybody. These Zigerions are always
trying to scam me out of my
secrets. But they made a big
mistake this time, Morty. They
tried to get to me through you.
They dragged you into this. Now
they’re gonna pay.
MORTY
What are we gonna do, Rick?
Rick and Morty keep walking.
RICK
We’re going to scam the scammers,
Morty. And we’re gonna take them
for everything they’ve got.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 10.
INT. PITCH ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Jerry stands at the end of a long boardroom table filled with
business people.
JERRY
National Apple Farmers of America,
welcome to our ad agency. I’m Jerry
Smith.
All of the simulated business people stare at him.
JERRY (CONT’D)
All right. I’ll just get to the
pitch. Um. Simple question,
gentlemen.
(dry throat)
What are apples -- excuse me.
Jerry nervously takes a sip of water.
JERRY (CONT’D)
What are apples? Apples are food.
And when do we need food? When
we’re hungry. With that, I give you
your new slogan:
He unveils a picture of an apple with the slogan “Hungry for
Apples?”
JERRY (CONT’D)
Because when people bite into an
apple, they want to feel like God
is feeding them.
There is a long pause. Jerry gets increasingly nervous, and
finally:
JERRY (CONT’D)
Well, say something, do you like
it?!
OLD MAN
Yes.
Jerry is taken aback.
JERRY
You do?
EVERYONE
Yes.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 11.
JERRY
So... I sold it? I sold the idea?
EVERYONE
Yes.
JERRY
Oh my God. Thank you.
EVERYONE
(re: everyone else)
Thank you. You’re welcome. Thank
you. You’re welcome.
We push on Jerry. “Baker Street” by Gerry Rafferty starts to
swell.
EXT. OFFICE - DAY
Jerry struts down the sidewalk as the sexy saxophone riff
continues. Dialing his cell phone. He passes three people
standing in a group: BLACK MAILMAN, HOT WOMAN, and OLD MAN.
JERRY
I just sold my first pitch!
OLD MAN
Slow down!
HOT WOMAN
Looking good!
BLACK MAILMAN
My man.
Jerry puts his ear to the phone.
SPLIT SCREEN with empty space. Nanotech clouds render a
phone, then render the kitchen counter it’s on, then render
Beth next to it. She picks up.
BETH
Hello.
JERRY
Guess who just sold the apples
campaign.
BETH
Who just sold the apples campaign?
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 12.
JERRY
Me! I guess it wasn’t a rip-off of
Got Milk after all? Guess someone
was wrong?
BETH
Yes.
JERRY
Well, all is forgiven, because
right now, I’ve got an erection the
size of an east coast lighthouse
and I’m coming home to share it
with my beautiful wife. Okay?
BETH
Okay.
JERRY
Really?
BETH
Yes.
JERRY
Yes! See you in ten minutes.
Jerry hangs up the phone.
JERRY (CONT’D)
I’m going to make love to my wife!
An identical set of Old Man, Hot Woman, and Black Mailman
appear just out of Jerry’s view. The mailman is “clipping”
into an adjacent tree.
HOT WOMAN
Looking good!
OLD MAN
Slow Down!
BLACK MAILMAN/HALF-TREE
My man.
INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty are standing behind a large curtain, dressed
in hip-hop clothing and gold chains.
MORTY
I don’t know about this plan, Rick.
Crowds make me nervous.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 13.
RICK
Morty, it’s a bunch of ones and
zeros out there, you’ll be fine.
Just follow my lead.
(yells offscreen)
Drop the beat!
EXT. STAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty burst onto a large stage set-up on the street,
like Dave Chappelle’s Block Party. A moderately sized crowd
has gathered. Hip hop music blasts from the speaker columns.
RICK
(into microphone)
Uh oh, Morty. This crowd looks too
small for one of our famous rap
concerts. I don’t think we can
perform our new song, “The Recipe
for Concentrated Dark Matter” for a
crowd this tiny.
MORTY
You got that right, Rick!
RICK
I guess we should just cancel the
concert, then.
Hundreds more gather, and scream. The crowd quickly reaches
critical mass.
RICK (CONT’D)
That’s more like it. Morty, here we
go!
The beat fills out and Rick hypes up the crowd.
RICK (CONT’D)
Let me hear everybody say “hoooo”!
CROWDMEMBERS
Hooo!
RICK
All the ladies say “yeah”!
FEMALE CROWDMEMBERS
Yeah!
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 14.
RICK
(gestures)
Everybody over thirty do this with
your hand!
(gestures)
Everybody with a red shirt jump up
and down!
(to Morty)
Yo, Morty, I don’t think they
understand. I don’t see the ladies
in red shirts over thirty saying
“yeah” while doing this gesture and
jumping!
MORTY
I guess they’re just not ready for
a rap about concentrated dark
matter, Rick!
The crowd follows his instructions. Things are becoming
visibly laggy.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY
A simulated girl is playing with a ball as Jerry’s car pulls
into the driveway. He doesn’t notice her ball “dropping
frames” or the tree in the front yard re-rendering its leaves
as he gets out and enters his home.
INT. HOUSE - DAY
A frozen Beth is still on the phone in the kitchen. Jerry
walks up to her, takes the phone out of her hand and starts
kissing her all over. She’s unresponsive. He doesn’t care.
He’s in the zone.
EXT. STAGE - DAY
The crowd at the rap concert are doing individual activities.
RICK
Everyone whose first name begins
with L who isn’t Hispanic, walk in
a circle the same number of times
as the square root of your age
times ten!
As a few people start to engage in that activity..
The glitching worsens.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 15.
RICK (CONT’D)
Morty, quick. Rap some nonsense.
Make them process your rhymes.
MORTY
A chicken in a peanut and a house
with a raisin /
run around together in a tiny
little station... (Justin will
adlib more at the recording here.)
The simulated crowd glitches until everything suddenly
FREEZES. The simulation has crashed. Rick grabs Morty and
pulls him from the stage. They sprint between frozen people.
RICK
Run, Morty! Before the system
reboots!
EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Cars and people have frozen outside of the Smith household.
We hear the bed squeaking.
JERRY (O.S.)
Yeah, you like that? Now who’s
unremarkable? You hungry for these
apples? Are you hungry... for...
(straining)
Apples?
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Jerry collapses next to Beth in a sweaty heap. She is
completely frozen with her arms outstretched.
JERRY
My God. That’s the best sex I’ve
ever had in my life.
Jerry looks happy for a beat before his expression changes to
concern.
JERRY (CONT’D)
It’s too good. My life is too good.
I don’t deserve this.
(deciding)
I’m a fraud.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 16.
EXT. STREET - DAY
Rick and Morty run through the frozen world.
MORTY
Rick, where are we running?
RICK
Out of the simulation, Morty!
Normally, the chamber operates like
a treadmill, with the virtual world
disappearing behind us and being
rendered in front of us as we move
through it. But while it’s frozen,
we can get to -
REVEAL: Rick and Morty stop running at the edge of the
simulation. Down below lies a massive network of cables and
metal spaceship innards.
RICK (CONT’D)
The edge. Here we go.
Rick leaps over the edge to the floor down below.
MORTY
Holy crap!
RICK
Come on, Morty!
Morty follows him into the bowels of the alien mothership.
INT. ALIEN CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
An alien watches this happen on a monitor.
ALIEN #2
Sir? They’re over the edge.
PRINCE NEBULON
Yes they are. Just. As. Planned.
All the aliens laugh.
PRINCE NEBULON (CONT’D)
This is going to be such a mind fEND
OF ACT ONE
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 17.
ACT TWO
INT. MOTHERSHIP - DAY
Rick and Morty stealthily make their way through alien
corridors.
RICK
Keep your eyes peeled for the
central processing room, Morty.
That’s how we’re going to scam
these idiots.
MORTY
Why do these aliens keep coming
after you, Rick, if you’re so much
smarter than them?
RICK
It’s an obsession for them at this
point. The Zigerions have been
trying to outsmart me for years,
and every time they do, I’m one
step ahead of them. Some people
just can’t make the heroic leap of
accepting my superiority. It’s a
common crime in this galaxy.
Rick identifies a large sign pointing to the “CPU room” and
the “escape pods”.
RICK (CONT’D)
Aha! Here we go.
INT. CENTRAL PROCESSING ROOM - SOON
The processing room is full of giant servers. Rick and Morty
enter.
RICK
Grab as many processors as you can
carry, Morty. These guys aren’t
good at much, but they’re great at
making these chips.
Rick and Morty pluck the processors from different servers.
Each unit powers down when the processor is removed.
MORTY
I’ve got so many I can barely hold
them all! I might accidentally drop
a few, actually...
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 18.
RICK
That’s fine, Morty. Come on. Let’s
get out of here.
Rick and Morty stealthily make their way out of the room and
back into the corrider. They head towards where the sign says
the escape pod room is.
INT. ESCAPE POD BAY - SOON
They sneak past alien guards, into an escape pod, and blast
off.
EXT. SPACE, OUTSIDE THE MOTHERSHIP - SOON
The escape pod flies out into space. We see Jupiter in the
foreground and Earth in the distance. They aren’t far from
home.
INT. ESCAPE POD - CONTINUOUS
Rick and Morty fly away, happy.
MORTY
Well whatya know, ha. That was
easy.
RICK
Hey, listen, sometimes stuff is
easy.
MORTY
Yeah, I guess so. Just kinda hard
to believe.
RICK
Believe it, Morty. Once again, I’m
flying away with everything I can
carry and the Zigerions got nothing
of mine.
We move from the escape pod, back to the alien mothership,
through its hull, through the wall of a simulation chamber
and into:
INT. BOSS’S OFFICE - DAY
Jerry shyly opens the door of his boss’ office.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 19.
JERRY
Mr. Marklevitz, do you have a
minute to talk?
Jerry’s boss, MR. MARKLEVITZ, a Roger Sterling type, is
standing in the corner of the room, facing the wall.
His boss’s legs start moving forward before he makes a turn,
like a character from Goldeneye 007 for Nintendo 64. He
executes a finger-point gun gesture to his left.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
Every Mr. Marklevitz line (“Yes”) from now on is accompanied
by the same finger-point gun gesture.
JERRY
I’m a fraud. I mean, let’s face it.
Hungry for Apples is just a rip-off
of Got Milk. It’s almost identical.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
He tugs at his hair, devastated.
JERRY
Okay, I deserved that. Um. I
guess... I’ll just pack up my desk.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
Jerry slinks toward the doorway, crying. He pauses. He turns
around and storms back into the room.
JERRY
You know what? No! The Milk people
don’t have a patent on simple
rhetorical questions! There’s not
even a single word in “Hungry For
Apples” that’s shared by “Got
Milk,” and it’s not the same number
of words! It’s a completely
different slogan! It’s different!
And I shouldn’t be fired, I should
be promoted!
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Yeah! Wait, really?
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 20.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Yes. Yes! I mean, it may be
derivative, but it’s the most
successful campaign to come out of
this agency in a long time!
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
I’m not saying it should win an
award for commercials, but it could
certainly be nominated for an award
for commercials specifically about
Apples, like an Appy or something!
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Hold on, really? Is there an award
called the Appys for apple related
ad campaigns?
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
JERRY
Holy crap! Could we nominate me?
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Yes.
Jerry composes himself. His confidence at an all time high.
JERRY
Thank you, Mr. Marklevitz.
Jerry exits stoically. Mr. Marklevitz glitches into the
middle of the board room table.
EXT. MORTY’S HOME - GARAGE - DAY
The escape pod lands in the Smith’s front yard. Rick and
Morty exit carrying the stolen processors.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 21.
INT. GARAGE - DAY
Rick darts over to his workbench and pulls a lever, revealing
a hidden safe.
RICK
We did it, Morty. I’m going to use
these processors to make some real
important science stuff.
He types in the code on a digital number pad. Nothing
happens.
RICK (CONT’D)
Huh. I thought I entered the code
right.
He enters the code again. Something is wrong.
The keypad dissolves away. Then the safe. Then the entire
garage, leaving Rick and Morty in a large, empty simulation
chamber. A door slides open and the aliens enter,
sarcastically clapping.
PRINCE NEBULON
Surprise! You thought you were in a
simulation, but you were in a
simulation INSIDE a simulation!
You’re still on the ship! We fooled
you!
RICK
What the hell? Why?
PRINCE NEBULON
(laughing)
We’ve known how to make
concentrated dark matter for a long
time. But now we also know the code
to your fabled safe, Rick Sanchez.
ALL your most valuable secrets will
now be ours!
RICK
Uh, yeah, until I get home before
you and change the combination, you
bunch of idiots.
PRINCE NEBULON
That is why you’re never getting
home. GET THEM!
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 22.
Alien #1 and Alien #2 grab Morty. Rick instinctively pulls
down Morty’s pants, exposing his genitals. The guards are
repulsed and stumble backwards.
RICK
Run, Morty!
Morty shuffles a short distance before pulling up his pants.
They run out of the simulation chamber and enter the
mothership. As they run down different corridors, they pass
several different scams in progress. Finally, they arrive at
a dead end, next to the entrance to another simulation
chamber.
RICK (CONT’D)
It’s a dead end, Morty. We’re going
to have to go through this thing to
get out of here.
Rick fries the panel near the entrance, crippling the
simulation system. They sprint into the chamber.
INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY
An awards show is in full swing. It’s filled with elegantly
dressed businesspeople. A banner above a podium reads “The
75th Annual Appy Awards.” Jerry is holding a freshly won Appy
Award while giving an acceptance speech.
JERRY
I gotta tell you, this morning, I
didn’t know this award existed. Now
I’m holding one, and...
(overwhelmed)
Um. Look, I want to say that today
was the best day of my life, but,
the truth is, it was more
meaningful than that.
The apple executives begin to glitch. Jerry is too in the
zone to notice.
BLACK MAILMAN
My man!
JERRY
Yes, thank you sir. I’ve
experienced the pride of true
accomplishment. And the hubris that
comes with pride. The fall that
comes after hubris and the
resurrection after that. I. Am.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 23.
(MORE)
(hefting award, deciding)
Finally complete. Thank you.
The simulated crowd begins to transform into different people
and objects. His boss turns into a banana. A few people turn
into the black mailman and say “my man.” The entire room
disappears, revealing a massive football field sized
simulation chamber.
JERRY (CONT’D)
What the hell?
Rick and Morty run toward Jerry in the distance.
MORTY
Dad?
RICK
Jerry?! What are you doing here?
Why are you dressed like a waiter?
Jerry is in shock and can’t respond.
RICK (CONT’D)
Screw it, we don’t have time.
C’mon.
Rick grabs Jerry and they run toward an exit door at the
other end of the simulation.
INT. CORRIDER - CONTINUOUS
The gang exits the simulation chamber and runs past several
rooms where the aliens are running other scams. Crazy “Cabin
in the Woods” type stuff. We see the aliens running a scam on
a race of toaster pastries, and 101 other zany things!
INT. HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER
Rick, Morty, and Jerry climb into a docked spaceship and
launch into space.
EXT./INT. SPACESHIP - CONTINUOUS
The hangar bay doors close as the stolen ship just barely
makes it out in time.
INT. COCKPIT - SPACE
Jerry sobs weakly in the corner.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 24.
JERRY (CONT'D)
RICK
Man up, Jerry, I may need you to
work the lasers.
A large, dangerous looking space vessel is gaining on their
small ship.
MORTY
Crap, they’re gaining on us fast,
Rick!
RICK
I guess they really do have
concentrated dark matter. We don’t
stand a chance.
MORTY
But you know how to make it, too,
right, Rick?
RICK
Sure, but there’s no way all the
ingredients would be on this tiny
ship.
MORTY
Well, I should at least look right?
What are they?
RICK
Okay, fine, try the engine room,
Morty. We just need caesium,
protonic quarks, and bottled water.
Morty darts into the engine room, and reappears with his arms
full.
MORTY
It’s all here Rick!
RICK
Wow, lucky break. Grab that bucket.
Morty picks up a bucket.
RICK (CONT’D)
Two parts protonic quarks, one part
caesium. And just shake it.
Morty mixes the ingredients and shakes the bucket.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 25.
RICK (CONT’D)
Now empty the water bottle into the
bucket and pour it all into the
fuel tank so we can get the hell
out of here!
Morty doesn’t do it.
RICK (CONT’D)
What are you doing, Morty? There’s
no time!
The ship and the environment dissolve away, sending everyone
falling a few feet to the ground. They are now inside the
biggest simulation chamber we’ve seen thus far. Morty slowly
dissolves into a cloud of nano particles.
JERRY
What the -
RICK
No. NO!
A door swishes opens up and the alien leader walks in,
laughing maniacally.
PRINCE NEBULON
Ho ho ho, game, set and match! You
were in a simulation of a
simulation inside a giant
simulation! We never had the recipe
for concentrated dark matter! BUT
NOW WE DO! NOW WE DO!
RICK
You simulated my grandson reacting
to simulations of simulations, you
diabolical sons of bitches!
All the aliens laugh, high-five, and backslap.
RICK (CONT’D)
Yeah, yeah. Great. You win. Can we
go home now?
ABDUCTIONS ALIEN
I don’t know, can you?
PRINCE NEBULON
Ha! Good one J.D.! Okay, okay. Show
this gullible dumb ass to a
shuttle. I’m done with him.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 26.
J.D. escorts Rick and Jerry out of the massive simulation
chamber.
EXT. SPACE OUTSIDE OF THE MOTHERSHIP - SOON
The pod blasts off into space. Jupiter can be seen in the
foreground. Earth in the far distance.
INT. ESCAPE POD - LATER
Rick and Jerry sit quietly. Jerry traces an apple into the
condensation on the window as he stares solemnly into space.
RICK
Hey, Jerry, don’t worry about it.
So what if the most meaningful day
of your life was a simulation
operating at minimum capacity. How
could you have known, right?
JERRY
You know what, Rick? Those guys
took you for a ride too. You should
try having a little respect for the
dummies of the universe now that
you’re one of us.
RICK
Maybe you’re right, Jerry. Maybe
you’re right.
Jerry smiles, knowing that, at least in this instance, he and
Rick are in the same boat.
INT. ALIEN CONTROL ROOM - THAT VERY MOMENT
The aliens have thrown an impromptu party to celebrate their
victory. They drink and laugh. Ticker tape and confetti fly.
The leader reads Rick’s instructions for anti-matter, while a
subordinate carefully mixes the ingredients together.
PRINCE NEBULON
Two parts plutonic quarks, one part
caesium...
He holds up the water bottle.
PRINCE NEBULON (CONT’D)
I’m sorry for yelling earlier. This
ship is going to feel real small
with outbursts like that.
RAM "SCAMMER ALIENS" NETWORK DRAFT (2/8/13) 27.
(MORE)
The truth is, I couldn’t ask for a
better staff.
He pours the water into the collider.
PRINCE NEBULON (CONT’D)
And the final ingredient...
EXT. ALIEN MOTHERSHIP - CONTINUOUS
Rick’s escape pod flies toward camera in the foreground. In
the distance behind it, the alien mothership explodes into a
giant ball of blue energy.
INT. ESCAPE POD - CONTINUOUS
Rick is unaffected by the explosion, but Jerry is startled
and whips around in his seat to look.
JERRY
What the hell?
(looks at Rick)
What happened back there?!
RICK
Why don’t you ask the smartest
people in the universe Jerry? Oh
yeah, you can’t. They blew up.
Rick turns on the radio. The sexy saxophone riff from “Baker
Street” by Gerry Rafferty plays. Rick reclines back in his
seat.
The pod continues on toward Earth.
END ACT TWO

TAG
INT. OFFICE - DAY
Jerry is pitching Hungry for Apples with vigor and
confidence.
JERRY
...because when people bite into an
apple, they want to feel like God
is feeding them.
He unveils a picture of an apple with the slogan “Hungry for
Apples?” The businessmen stare at him for a long beat.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
You’re fired.
JERRY
Okay.
Jerry exits. Everyone is bummed out.
MR. MARKLEVITZ
Man, how does a guy like that go
home and have sex with his wife?
