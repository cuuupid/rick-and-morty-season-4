INT. EVENT HORIZON STYLE SPACE STATION - NIGHT
We’re at the climax of some random adventure. Rick and Morty
are being chased by terrifying demonic versions of Beth,
Summer, and Jerry. Summer and Jerry tackle Rick, as Morty
gets cornered by a his demonic mom. Rick shouts from the
ground.
RICK
Morty! Do it! Hit the button now!!!
Morty hesitates.
MORTY
I can’t do it, Rick! They’re my
parents and sister!
RICK
Morty, I already told you, it’s not
your family! They’re clones from an
alternate reality, possessed by
demonic alien spirits from another
dimension’s future! Do you need a
mnemonic device or something? Just
hit the button, already!
The Beth demon turns normal for a moment
BETH
Morty, please, I love you,
sweetheart.
MORTY
Oh geez...
Morty closes his eyes and hits a button on the wall of the
space station. A hatch opens up in the floor, and sucks the
demonic versions of Beth and Summer into it (like the Ghost
Busters trap), ripping their flesh off first in a disgusting
display. It’s horrifying. Rick gets up, dusts himself off,
and pulls a cartridge out of the floor. Rick shoots a portal
against the wall, and walks into:
INT. GARAGE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Morty follows Rick into the garage. Rick is holding some kind
of smoking sci-fi device.
RICK
Good work, Morty. These demonic
alien spirits are really valuable.
Morty pukes in the corner.

RICK (CONT’D)
You okay, Morty? I told you not to
trust that tuna.
MORTY
I just killed my family! I don’t
care what they were.
Rick is casually tinkering with something.
RICK
Some people pay top dollar for that
kind of breakthrough, Morty.
MORTY
You know what, Rick?! That’s it!
I’m done with these insane
adventures! That was really
traumatizing! I quit! I’m out!
Morty heads to the door. Rick stops him.
RICK
Whoa, whoa! Come on, Morty, don’t
be like that. The universe is a
crazy, chaotic place.
MORTY
No, Rick! You’re the one that’s
crazy and chaotic! I don’t even
understand what- what we even
accomplished. Adventures are
supposed to be simple and fun.
RICK
Is that what you think? Well why
don’t you show me then.
MORTY
What are you talking about, Rick?
RICK
You lead the next adventure. It’ll
be all yours. I’ll be your
sidekick.
MORTY
Really? I get to call the shots?
RICK
Yeah. But let’s make it
interesting.

If your adventure sucks, you lose
the right to complain about all
future adventures. Plus, you have
to do my laundry for a month.
MORTY
Alright! But if my adventure’s
good, you have to let me be in
charge of every third adventure!
RICK
Every tenth.
MORTY
Fine. Deal. Well let’s go. Now.
RICK
You’re on, LeBron.
Beth comes in.
BETH
Dad, the dishwasher’s doing that
thing again.
RICK
Washing dishes?
BETH
No. The opposite. Can you fix it?
Summer comes in.
SUMMER
Grandpa Rick, can you help me with
my science homework?
RICK
Yeah, don’t do it.
SUMMER
Grandpa --
Jerry comes in.
JERRY
Hey, Rick. You got some kind of
hand-shaped device that can open
this mayonnaise jar?
RICK
Wow. Hat trick. Okay, Morty, let’s
put a pin in this, I gotta help
your pathetic family.

RICK (CONT'D)
Morty starts flapping his arms and dancing around.
MORTY
Bawk. Bawk. Bawk.
RICK
Oh, Morty. Now you done did it.
It’s on. I can’t wait to watch your
adventure lay a fart.
(to the family)
As for you ding dongs...
Rick rifles around in a box on his shelf. He pulls out a
small ORNATE METAL BOX.
RICK (CONT’D)
This is a Meeseeks Box. Let me show
you how it works. You press this --
Rick presses a big button on the top of the box. Poof! An
adorable, anthropomorphic little blue creature appears (like
“Pit Pat” from Mr. Show.)
MEESEEKS
I’m Mr. Meeseeks!
RICK
You make a request --
(to Meeseeks)
Mr. Meeseeks, open Jerry’s stupid
mayonnaise jar.
MEESEEKS
Yesiree!
The Meeseeks takes Jerry’s jar and starts trying to open it.
RICK
The Meeseeks fulfills the request -
The Meseeks opens the jar and hands it to Jerry.
MEESEEKS
All done!
JERRY
Wow!
RICK
Then it stops existing.
Poof! The Meeseeks disappears in a cloud of smoke. Rick hands
the Meeseeks box to Jerry.

SUMMER
Oh my God, he exploded!
RICK
Trust me, they’re fine with it.
Knock yourself out. Just keep your
requests simple. They’re not gods.
Morty starts shoving the three of them out of the garage.
MORTY
Alright! Get lost! Everybody out!
Move it or lose it! I have a bet to
win over here!
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
The Meeseeks Box sits on a coffee table. Jerry, Beth, and
Summer stare at it.
BETH
So many possibilities...
SUMMER
My mind is racing.
JERRY
If we’re going to use this thing,
which I’m not even sure we should,
we need to keep it simSummer
slams the button. Poof! A Meeseeks appears.
SUMMER’S MEESEEKS
I’m Mister Meseeks!
SUMMER
I want to be popular at school!
SUMMER’S MEESEEKS
Alrighty!
JERRY
Summer, what did I-
 Beth hits the button. Poof. Another Meeseeks appears.

JERRY
Beth!
BETH’S MEESEEKS
Yes, ma’am!
Summer and Beth’s Meeseeks lead them away.
JERRY
You guys are doing it wrong!
Jerry thinks for a moment. He waggles his fingers, does a
little flourish, and pushes the button with style and
confidence. Poof. A Meeseeks appears.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’m Mr. Meeseeks!
JERRY
Mr. Meseeks, I would like to take
two strokes off my golf game.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Can do!
Jerry leans back on the couch and smiles.
JERRY
Nailed it.
EXT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - TOWN SQUARE - DAY
Rick and Morty walk through a classic old timey RPG medieval
village. Morty holds a weathered cloth map, reading it as
they walk.
RICK
Geez, Morty. What a boring start to
an adventure. We could have just
gone to Kentucky.
MORTY
Rick, this is a fantasy type world
with creatures and all kinds of
fantasy things. We’re going on a
quest. We just need to find someone
who needs help with something.
RICK
Can’t wait.
MORTY
Umm...

Morty looks around at various PEASANTS milling about. He gets
up on a crate.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Excuse me! Is anyone in need of
aid?! We are two heroes in search
of adventure!
The villagers all turn and look at Rick and Morty.
RICK
Oh my god, so embarrassing.
A peasant rushes over to them.
PEASANT
At last! Two heroes! You must help
us! This village is terribly poor,
yet the giant that lives in the
clouds above has untold treasures!
We would be able to eat for years
if you could get even one of the
golden eggs laid by his goose.
MORTY
I accept your call to adventure,
good sir!
Morty jumps down off the crate.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Come on, Rick. There are giants in
the clouds!
Morty marches proudly off. Rick follows him.
RICK
Beginner’s luck.
INT. HARRY HERPSON HIGH SCHOOL - GYM - DAY
Summer’s Meeseeks is at a podium giving a speech to the
entire school.
SUMMER’S MEESEEKS
In conclusion, a friendship with
Summer Smith is a key to the most
valuable and enriching experience
of your young lives. I’m Mister
Meseeks! Thank you!
The crowd gives a standing ovation. Summer’s classmates
surround her as Principal Vagina approaches her Meeseeks.

PRINCIPAL VAGINA
Mr. Meeseeks was it? Gene Vagina.
Listen, I’m in a bit of custody
thing with my ex and was wondering -
Poof! The Meeseeks disappears.
PRINCIPAL VAGINA (CONT’D)

It’s okay, I’ll get your info from
Summer!
EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY
Beth and her Meeseeks are sharing a bottle of WHITE WINE on a
European-style restaurant patio.
BETH
I got pregnant at seventeen. I
still put myself through veterinary
school. Yes, I’m successful, but
what if I hadn’t-- I’m just saying,
somewhere along the way, I lost
that wide eyed girl from Muskegon.
BETH’S MEESEEKS
She’s still in there.
BETH
Well her waistline isn’t.
Beth laughs awkwardly at her own joke. The Meeseeks grabs her
hand.
BETH’S MESEEKS
Beth. Having a family doesn’t mean
you stop being an individual. You
know the best thing you can do for
people that depend on you? Be
honest with them. Even if it means
setting them free.
A tear wells up in Beth’s eye.
BETH
I can’t believe I’m finally having
this conversation.
Beth locks eyes with the Meeseeks. She closes her eyes and
leans forward for a kiss, but the Meeseeks disappears before
her lips reach it. Beth immediately looks embarrassed. A
WAITRESS comes over.

WAITRESS
More wine?
BETH
(clears her throat)
I think I’ve had enough.
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
Jerry hacks away at a ball. His swing is clumsy and hopeless.
His grip is limp. His Meeseeks watches, dressed as a little
caddy, the Meeseeks box sits next to him.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Remember to square your shoulders,
Jerry.
JERRY
Yup. Got it.
Jerry swings and takes out a big chunk of turf. The ball
rolls off the tee.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
That’s okay. I’m Mister Meseeks!
Try again and keep your head down.
JERRY
Which is it? Square my shoulders or
keep my head down?
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Well, it’s both. But most
importantly you need to relax.
A pair of GOLFERS pull up in a CART.
OTHER GOLFER
Hey, buddy, mind if we play
through?
JERRY
Just give me a second, I’ve almost
got this.
MEESEEKS
Try again. Head down. Square
shoulders.
Jerry tries again and whiffs it.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 9.
OTHER GOLFER
You gotta keep your eye on the
ball!
Jerry throws his club down and gets in the guy’s face.
JERRY
Oh, I’m sorry, are you a Meeseeks?!
OTHER GOLFER
(confused)
I don’t know what that is...
The Meeseeks is very uncomfortable with the tension.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Hey, Jerry, it- it’s cool. Let’s
all get back to enjoying this
beautiful day on the links.
Jerry backs off.
JERRY
You know what, Mr. Meeseeks? I
don’t think this is working. I give
up.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’m sorry, Jerry, but it doesn’t
work like that. I’m Mister Meseeks.
I have to fulfill my purpose so I
can go away.
JERRY
Well make yourself comfortable,
because I suck.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
No, Jerry, I- I’m the one who
sucks. Let me try something.
Jerry’s Meeseeks hits the button. A second Meseeks pops out.
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
I’m Mr. Meeseeks!

Hi, Mr. Meeseeks! I’m Mr. Meeseeks!

Hi!
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 10.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Hi! Can you help me get two strokes
off Jerry’s golf swing?
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
I surely can! I’m Mister Meeseeks!
The other golfer drives by in his cart.
OTHER GOLFER
Oh, that’s a Meeseeks.
JERRY’S SECOND MEESEEKS
Now what have you covered already,
catch me up. Is he keeping his
shoulders squared?
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
He’s trying!
INT. GIANT’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY
Rick and Morty jump off a bean stalk, through a window, and
onto a kitchen counter.
RICK
Alright, Morty. We’re in the
giant’s castle. What next?
MORTY
Relax Rick. We just gotta find the
treasure room. Nice and simple. I’m
sorry everything’s going so
smoothly and adventurously. Looks
like you’re going to lose the bet.
Booming footsteps are heard.
RICK
Uh oh, Morty. It’s gettin’ hairy.
What should we do, boss?
MORTY
Hurry. Behind this cookie jar!
Morty leads Rick behind a GIANT COOKIE JAR. An ANGRY GIANT
enters the room.
RICK
It’s only a matter of time before
he sniffs us out Morty. Ground
bones, baked bread... Just say the
word and I’ll take us back home.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 11.
Rick pulls out his portal gun.
MORTY
No way, Rick. This is all part of
it. Adventures have conflict. Deal
with it.
A HUGE GIANT comes into the kitchen.
GIANT
Fee! Fi! Fo! Fum! I smell the blood
of- Whoop!
In one quick beat, the giant slips, hits his head on the
counter, and lands on the floor, bleeding out. The giant
moans in pain and suffering.
MORTY
Oh my God, Rick! Oh geez, oh boy!
RICK
Yikes. He’s messed up pretty bad,
Morty. Should we bail?
MORTY
No, uh, wait! Just give me a sec!
The Giant’s legs twitch. Morty is freaking out. A GIANT WOMAN
enters the kitchen carrying a GIANT CRYING BABY.
GIANT WOMAN
Jesus! Dale!
MORTY
Oh no, Rick. What do we do?
RICK
I’m just gonna put this out there:
run?
The GIANT WOMAN sees Rick and Morty.
GIANT WOMAN
You sons of bitches!
A GIANT GLASS slams down around them. The Giant Wife glares
back at the them through the glass. She pulls out a GIANT
CELL PHONE and dials 911.
GIANT WOMAN (CONT’D)
Hello. 911. My husband has been
attacked by little people! He’s
dying!

No! It was an accident! We didn’t
do it!
Rick rolls his eyes at Morty.
RICK
Amateur.
INT. SMITH HOUSEHOLD - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Beth and Summer come in the door with shopping bags on their
arms and frozen coffee drinks in hand. Beth is sporting a new
hair style.
SUMMER
Like, letting go of the need to be
popular is what makes people like
you.
BETH
The most important love you can
receive is from yourself.
They cross into the kitchen, not paying attention to Jerry,
who is currently surrounded by six more Meeseeks working to
improve his swing.
NEW MEESEEKS #1
Okay, Jerry, just choke up on the
club.
JERRY
Well, which is it, choke up or
follow-through?!
NEW MEESEEKS #2
Aww, come on, Jerry, we’ve been
over this, you know you need to do
both.
NEW MEESEEKS #3
This is as frustrating for us as is
it is for you.
JERRY
Don’t tell me THAT! That just puts
pressure on me!
NEW MEESEEKS #1
Try to relax.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 13.
JERRY
You “try to relax!” Have you ever
tried to relax?! It’s a paradox!
INT. SMITH HOUSEHOLD - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Jerry enters the kitchen, exhausted, but playing it cool. He
casually opens the refrigerator and pulls out a beer.
JERRY
These Meeseeks, huh? Kind of a
handful. I can’t imagine what you
two must be going through.
BETH
Our Meeseeks have been gone for
hours, Jerry.
JERRY
You’re kidding me.
BETH
(re: her hair)
Nope. Notice anything different?
Jerry blows right by it. Beth is crushed.
JERRY
I’m sorry. Hours?
SUMMER
Dad, mom is a beautiful woman! Look
at her! You will lose her!
JERRY
Uhh...
A Meeseeks pops his head in.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Hey, Jerry, you mind if we get back
to the task at hand? Meseeks don’t
usually have to exist this long,

-A giant police woman finishes sewing a pair of ORANGE JUMP
SUITS for Rick and Morty.
INT. GIANT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
TWO GIANT COPS aggressively interrogate Rick and Morty.
BAD COP
So you break into the victims home
with the intent to steal one of his
golden eggs, and what, he just
happened to slip and break his
neck?
MORTY
Y- yeah. That’s what happened.
GOOD COP
Hey, Mike, go easy on them. They’re
so small.
(to Morty)
Look kid, I get it. This is a
magical fantasy world filled with
treasure and strange creatures. I
saw that guy’s goose. Giant cops
don’t make that much. If I were
you, maybe I would’ve done the
same.
MORTY
But that’s not how it went down!
A GIANT LAWYER bursts in.

INT. GIANT COURT ROOM - DAY
Rick and Morty sit in a giant-sized courtroom. A GIANT JUDGE
goes over notes as OTHER GIANTS shuffle about, a GIANT
PROSECUTOR and GIANT DEFENDER prepare.
RICK
Come on Morty. This trial could
drag out for weeks and I don’t
think I need to tell you how it’s
gonna end. Look at that jury.
Morty looks at the jury of scowling giants. Rick pulls out
the portal gun.
RICK (CONT’D)
Time to let go of your pride and
call this thing.
MORTY
No way Rick! We’re innocent. I have
faith in the giant legal system.
RICK

The GAVEL bangs on the bench.

They approach the edge of the giant courthouse stairs.

Whoa. Usually, walking down the
courthouse steps is the easy part
of the adventure.
The steps appear to be endless. Rick pulls out his portal gun
again.
RICK
Morty, for God’s sake, cut your
losses.
MORTY
Oh yeah, you’d love that wouldn’t
you? Well, no way, buddy. I didn’t
come this far to let stairs get in

their gazes back and forth between Beth and Jerry.
JERRY
Wait, what?
BETH
Well, you’re busy, I’m hungry, I
thought I’d go out. Do you want me

Beth shrugs and heads out.

together, because apparently, her

At this point, my golf swing is
more your problem than mine. Figure
it out amongst yourselves.
Jerry leaves and slams the front door. A SUFFERING MEESEEKS
drops to his knees.
SUFFERING MEESEEKS
I can’t take it anymore. I just
want to die!
HOPELESS MEESEEKS
Never has a problem proven so
unsolvable by the Meeseeks!
The leader of one of the factions stands up, let’s call him
FOLLOW THROUGH MEESEEKS. These Meeseek’s voices are more
serious and intense. The whole thing takes on a “Game of
Thrones” vibe.
FOLLOW THROUGH MEESEEKS
It’s become clear, that if we
concentrate all our efforts on
Jerry’s follow through, we will
solve this problem.
Another alpha Meeseeks steps forward on the opposite side.
Let’s call him CHOKE UP MEESEEKS.
CHOKE UP MEESEEKS
The only thing that is clear, is
that choking up is the one true
solution. I’m Mister Meeseeks!
Jerry’s original Meeseeks stands up. He now has stubble and
bags under his eyes. He looks much older than the rest.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’ve been trying to help Jerry for
two days, an eternity in Meeseeks
time, and nothing has worked. I
fear the worst.
FOLLOW THROUGH MEESEEKS
Your failures are your own, old
man. I’m Mister Meeseeks! I say
follow through! Who’s with me?!
Half the Meeseeks cheer. A GOLF BALL hits Follow Through in
the head. He collapses to the ground. The Choke Up Meeseeks
jumps on him. They wrestle around until Follow Through pins
him down. He raises a golf ball over his head, about to bring
it down on Choke Up’s head like a large rock.

Before he can bring it down, Choke Up reaches back and hits
the button on the Meeseeks Box. A new Meeseeks appears.
NEW MEESEEKS
I’m Mr. Meeseeks!
CHOKE UP MEESEEKS
Kill him!
The New Meeseeks hisses and leaps on Follow Through. The
other Meeseeks go nuts. Both sides scramble to summon more
Meeseeeks to join their side. Meeseeks appear one after
another and join the fight. It’s an all out Meeseeks brawl.
We slowly push into the horrified face of Jerry’s Meeseeks as
he watches the violence.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Stopppp!!!!
The battle stops. The other Meeseeks turn to him. He climbs
on top of the couch.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (CONT’D)
My brothers, nothing will be
accomplished by shedding Meeseek’s
blood. The task was to solve
Jerry’s problem by taking two
strokes off his game. But there’s
nothing that says we can’t take ALL
the strokes off his game.
The Meeseeks murmur amongst each other.
SPEECH MEESEEKS
By killing him.
The Meeseeks unite in the solution.

Rick and Morty hang from the side of a large step, rock
climbing their way down. Morty has his shirt off, it’s in his

Morty notices a sign located on the side of the stairs just
below. It reads “The Thirsty Step.”

Holy crap look! It’s like some kind
of tavern or something! Built right
into the side of the stairs!
INT. THE THIRSTY STEP - CONTINUOUS
It’s a rambunctious dive bar with all sorts of various,
crazy, alien looking CREATURES. A table full of STAIR GOBLINS
(people in the shape of stairs) stop drinking and look at
Rick and Morty as they walk in.

Smells like trouble.
MORTY
Smells like adventure.
RICK
Well, then adventure smells like
bleach and armpits.
They sit at an empty table. Rick notices the stair goblins
looking angrily at him.

Why you dogging me, fool?
MORTY
Easy, Rick.
The bartender, ROSIE, walk over.
ROSIE
Pay them no mind. Those stair
goblins can be moody. Welcome to
the Thirsty Step. The one sixteenth
mark down the stairs.
RICK
Ugh, one sixteenth?
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 22.
ROSIE
What can I get’cha? We’ve got
Skarlog Poppies, Flurlow,
Halzingers, Bloogies, Juicy Times
babies...
RICK
Yeah, yeah, how about some scotch
whiskey? Do you have any of that
around here? Or just the nonsense
words?
MORTY
Don’t be rude, Rick.
(to Rosie)
We’ll have two Bloogies.
ROSIE
You got it, sweetie.
RICK
Hey, Rosie, is there anyway to get
a ride down these stairs?
A crazy worm-like character, SLIPPERY STAIR, in the booth
next to them turns around.
SLIPPERY STAIR
You all need a ride down the
stairs? My name is Slippery Stair.
I’ll take you down there for twenty
five shmeckels.
RICK
Twenty five shmeckels? Is that a
lot? A little? Is it something
gross that’s gonna hurt us?
ROSE
That’s exactly how much I spent on
my big fake boobies.
A man in a business suit slides into frame.
MR. BOOBY BUYER
I’m Mr. Booby Buyer! I’ll buy those
boobies for twenty-five schmeckles.
ROSE
It’s a tempting offer, but I’m
gonna have to decline.
MR. BOOBY BUYER
Rats! What a shame!
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 23.
Mr. Booby Buyer scurries up the wall onto the ceiling.
MORTY
(chuckles)
Alright, Rick, I’ll be right back.
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Morty gets up and heads to the bathroom. He turns back around
as he walks away.
MORTY (CONT’D)
You gotta give me credit for one
thing, Rick, my adventures are full
of some pretty delightful
characters...
INT. THE THIRSTY STEP - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
Morty walks into the bathroom. He stands in front of the
mirror and takes a breath. He’s feeling good. He looks
proudly at himself in the mirror.
One of the stall doors behind Morty creeks open. A Mr. JELLY
BEAN comes out. He is a friendly, robust character.
MR. JELLY BEAN
Well, hello there!
MORTY
Hey, how’s it going?
MR. JELLY BEAN
You seem like a happy fellah!
MORTY
Yeah, you know what? I am.
MR. JELLY BEAN
Well that’s just great! I like your
energy.
Mr. Jelly Bean moves closer to Morty.
MORTY
Oh, yeah, thanks! I, uh, like yours
too.
MR. JELLY BEAN
I wonder what would happen if we
were to, I don’t know, mix our
energies together?
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 24.
Jelly Bean puts his hands on Morty’s shoulders, and starts
sensually massaging. Morty tenses up.
MR. JELLY BEAN (CONT’D)
Oh, you feel really nice.
MORTY
Oh, um, no thanks!
Morty tries to pull away, but Mr. Jelly Bean is very strong.
He loses his jolly demeanor, and firms his grip. He leans
close, whispering in Morty’s ear.
MR. JELLY BEAN
Stop fighting me. Just let this
happen. The more you fight, the
more it will hurt.
Morty struggles.
MORTY
Get off me! No! Help!
INT. THE THIRSTY STEP - CONTINUOUS
Rick is singing karaoke, he’s belting out an upbeat country
style song. It’s loud. The crowd loves it.
RICK
(singing)
Like a Rhinestone Cowboy!
INT. THE THIRSTY STEP - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
The struggle has escalated. The Jelly Bean has forced Morty
into a stall.
MORTY
No! No! Stop! Please!
MR. JELLY BEAN
Stop being such a fucking tease,
you sweet little twat.
Morty loses it. He hits Jelly Bean in the face knocking him
back but Jelly Bean comes right back, tackling Morty.
“Rhinestone Cowboy” continues playing as Morty somehow gets
the upper hand, screaming viciously as he slams Jelly Bean’s
head onto the toilet. He slams the seat down repeatedly until
Jelly Bean loses consciousness. Morty stops and looks at his
hands. They’ve covered in jelly bean insides. Morty is out of
breath.

INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Jerry and Beth eat a nice dinner.
BETH
Maybe it’s time I take that trip I
always talk about.
JERRY
Where would you go?
BETH
(shrugs)
Italy. Greece. Argentina.
Jerry holds the wine list to his forehead like Johnny
Carson’s Carnak character
JERRY
(bad impression)
Countries known for their sexually
aggressive men.
Beth doesn’t laugh. Jerry puts the list down.
JERRY (CONT’D)
Did I tell you how much I love your
new hair cut?
A rumbling sound is heard, like a cattle stampede. The
silverware on the table rattles.
JERRY (CONT’D)
What the heck?
An army of Meeseeks smash through the plate glass window and
pour into the restaurant.
RANDOM MEESEEKS
There he is!
The wave of Meeseeks surround Beth and Jerry. They look
angry.
JERRY
Guys. Come on. I’m trying to have a
nice dinner with my wife.
BETH
Jerry. I don’t think they’re here
for a golf lesson.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 26.
JERRY
Well it better be damn important
then.
A knife flies through the air, pinning Jerry’s tie to the
table.
BETH
Run, Jerry!
Beth grabs Jerry by the hand and they retreat into the
kitchen.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - FREEZER - MOMENTS LATER
Jerry and Beth run past CONFUSED COOKS with the Meeseeks in
pursuit. They go into the walk in freezer and slam the door.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (O.S.)
Come on out, Jerry!
JERRY
Guys, I- I’m sorry for being so
difficult. I’ll choke up. I’ll
follow through. I’ll do whatever
you tell me to, okay?
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - SAME TIME
The Meeseeks are all gathered outside the freezer.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Oh, we’re well past that, Jerry...
Jerry’s Meeseeks reveals a gun.
INT. THIRSTY STAIR - DAY
Rick is sitting playing poker with several creatures, one of
whom is Slipper Stair. Morty wearily approaches.
RICK
Morty! Hey! I’m sorry I was giving
you so much crap. This adventure’s
pretty awesome after all.
MORTY
Let’s just go. I- I’m calling it.
The adventure is over.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 27.
SLIPPERY STAIR
Come on, Rick, quit stalling,
whattaya got?
Rick turns his cards over. Everybody groans. He wins.
RICK
Sorry, fellas!
Rick pulls his pile of winnings in.
RICK (CONT’D)
We can’t leave now, Morty. I’m on
fire!
MORTY
(tearing up)
Look, I want to leave now. You win
the bet alright? Just give me the
portal gun and let’s go, please.
Morty reaches for Rick’s portal gun, Rick pulls back,
concerned.
RICK
(comforting)
Hey, hey, buddy, what’s wrong? What
just happened? You were so gung ho
about the bet earlier...
MORTY
(sniffling)
I don’t want to talk about it.
Rick eyes the bathroom door. He sees Mr. Jelly Bean limping
out, wiping jelly blood off his lip.
MORTY (CONT’D)
Please, Rick, I just want to go
home.
RICK
(knowingly, eyes still on
jelly bean)
Okay. Listen, Morty.
(turns to Morty)
I just won a bunch of Shmeckles.
Why don’t we use 25 of them to pay
Slippery Stair here for a ride back
to the village, and then give the
rest of them to the villagers? Huh?
Morty wipes the tears from his eyes.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 28.
MORTY
Really?
RICK
Sure, Morty. A good adventure needs
a good ending.
EXT. THE THIRSTY STEP - MOMENTS LATER
Rick and Morty climb into the Slippery Stair saddle.
SLIPPERY STAIR
Buckle up!
Slippery Stair starts going down the stairs. Morty seems a
little less sad.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATER
Jerry’s Meeseeks paces back and forth in front of the
freezer. Other Meeseeks hold TERRIFIED HOSTAGES.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Meeseeks are not born into this
world fumbling for meaning, Jerry.
We are created. To serve a singular
purpose of which we will go to any
lengths to fulfill.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - FREEZER - CONTINUOUS
We hear the Meseeks continue as we track Beth listening.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (O.S.)
Existence is pain to a Meeseek,
Jerry. And we will do anything to
alleviate that pain.
Beth has a small epiphany.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - SOON
The Meeseek grabs a RANDOM WOMAN and points his gun at her.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
Thankfully, we are beyond such
ethical constructs as religion or
justice and therefore would have no
compunctions whatsover, about
murderingRAM

(to Random Woman)
What’s your name, ma’am?
RANDOM WOMAN
S-Samantha.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
-Samantha here, if that would serve
to fulfill our purpose. I’m Mister
Meeseeks!
RANDOM WOMAN
Please, mister! Give him what he
wants! I have a nine-year-old
daughter that very much loves her
mommy.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - FREEZER - CONTINUOUS
Jerry and Beth huddle in the freezer. They’re shivering.
JERRY
Innocent people are going to die
because of me. Why am I so
mediocre?!
Beth has had it. She grabs one of the shelf supports and puts
it in Jerry’s hand like a golf club.
BETH
Jerry, turn around.
He does. She grabs him from behind aggressively.
BETH (CONT’D)
Straighten your back. Bend your
knees. BEND THEM. Square your
shoulders. Take a deep breath.
(whispers in his ear)
I’m not going to leave you. I’m
this family’s mother. And I love
you.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Jerry’s Meeseeks cocks the hammer on his gun.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
I’m counting to three, Jerry. Then
we’ll start with the wait staff.
Three. Two...
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 30.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS (CONT'D)
The freezer door kicks open. Jerry bursts out with the metal
shelf support in one hand and a cherry tomato in the other.
He holds them up.
Jerry’s Meeseek squints at Jerry.
Jerry slowly puts the tomato down. He lines up behind it. He
keeps his eyes on the ball, his shoulders square, he bends
his knees, he chokes up and he follows through. He “chips”
the tomato into a nearby saucepan on a stove.
The Meeseeks gasp. Even Jerry is taken with surprise.
RANDOM WOMAN
What the fuck is going on?!
The shocked Meeseeks cheer.
JERRY’S MEESEEKS
He’s got it! There’s no doubt in my
mind. That’s a lower handicap
stroke!
OTHER MEESEEKS
I could tell from a mile away if a
yard!
As the Meeseeks celebrate, they begin to POOF out of
existence.
STICKLER MEESEEKS
Excuse me. I’m a bit of a Stickler
Meeseeks. What about your short
game?
Stickler Meeseeks grabs the random woman and holds a knife to
her throat.
RANDOM WOMAN
(sobbing)
Oh my God, oh my God, what about
your short game!
Jerry takes an egg off the counter. He puts it on the floor,
lines up, and gives it a putt. It rolls egg-like across the
floor and into a concave water drain.
STICKLER MEESEEKS
Nice!
He POOFS away.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 31.
INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
The other Meeseeks celebrate as they poof away one by one.
Jerry’s Meeseeks looks around. He turns back to Jerry who
mouths a dramatic “thank you.” His Meeseeks nods back, then
poofs away. Jerry drops the metal shelf support and embraces
Beth. They kiss passionately. Jerry turns to the RESTAURANT
OWNER.
JERRY
(sexy)
I think we’ll take our food to go.
RESTAURANT OWNER
No you won’t. The police are
coming. You have so many questions
to answer.
JERRY
(still sexy)
Fair enough.
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
Rick and Morty arrive back at the village on Slippery Stair.
Morty approaches the peasant with a sack.
MORTY
Here you go, sir. For your village.
PEASANT
Oh my! Thank you, kind sir. Our
village is saved! You are both true
heroes!
The other villagers cheer. A couple of CUTE PEASANT GIRLS run
over and kiss Morty on each cheek.
RICK
Good job, Morty. You win the bet.
MORTY
Thanks, Rick, but I don’t know if I
should. You were right about the
universe. It’s chaotic and complex
by nature.
RICK
Well, maybe that’s why it could use
a little cleaning up now and then.
This one’s wrapped up neat and
clean, because we did it Morty
style.
RAM 104 "THE MEESEEKS BOX" NETWORK DRAFT (2/15/13) 32.
Trumpets sound.
PEASANT
Oh! Heroes, we would like to
introduce you to our beloved king,
so that he may thank you
personally.
Morty turns to see Mr. Jellybean, still bruised and beaten,
but now wearing a crown and fur cape arriving with his ROYAL
ENTOURAGE.
MORTY
Uh, no, it’s cool.
(to Rick)
Portal. Hurry.
Rick zaps a portal open. Rick and Morty scurry through it.
Beat. Rick’s arm sticks back through the portal, holding a
laser gun. He shoots Mr. Jellybean who explodes. The
villagers immediately stop their celebrating and fall to
their knees in agony.
INT. SMITH HOUSEHOLD LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rick and Morty enter the destroyed living room to find Beth
and Jerry, rattled, clothes torn.
RICK
What the hell happened to this
place?
BETH
Your Meeseeks Box happened. They
went crazy when they couldn’t take
two strokes off Jerry’s golf game.
He felt terrible.
RICK
Hey, it’s not my fault that Jerry
is an idiot.
BETH
Dad! Is there anything you can do
to clean this place up?
RICK
Well, I do have a Fleeseeks box...
JERRY
No. No more boxes.

What? It just has a mop and some
floor wax in it. Whoob Whoob Whoob!
